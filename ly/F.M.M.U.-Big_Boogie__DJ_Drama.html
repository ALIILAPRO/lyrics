		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see
I'ma treat these bitches like a mixtape
First I'ma talk that shit to her
Then she's gonna get the bass (grrr)
Might have to run it back a couple times
I'ma have her screamin' like all the bells and whistles
And when we done, she's gonna say it was legendary (grrr)
(Ayy, Carter Z, you goin' too crazy)

Time up, baby, fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
You can't find her, pussy fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
Fuck her spine up, somewhere they can't find us (they can't, ooh)
Toxic kind of, can't nothing rewind us (I got ooh, grrr)
Time up, baby, fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
You can't find her, pussy fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
Fuck her spine up, somewhere they can't find us (they can't, ooh)
Toxic kind of, can't nothing rewind us (I got ooh, grrr)

Shawty got a walk I never seen, shit got me sprung (runway)
She fuck with BigFude because I'm wild she know I'm young (BigDude)
She fuck with my music real heavy, she bad on John (John-John)
Give her back shots with this chocolate choppa dada gun (grrr)
She can ride dick backwards (ayy, ayy), look back blushing having fun (slow down)
Take dick raw, she grab my balls, she trying to have my son (son, son)
Licked her neck and lifted her dress, bae, shut up better not run (ooh)
Shoot that club up if that pussy mine, come grip this gun (bend it)

Back shots, long stroke her, make that pussy fart
Beat her shit and leave it throbbing, that pussy got hard (ugh ugh)
Finna bust, she grab my nuts, damn that pussy smart (ooh)
Now she spoiled, no more toys, good dick in her jaws (grrr)

Time up, baby, fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
You can't find her, pussy fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
Fuck her spine up, somewhere they can't find us (they can't, ooh)
Toxic kind of, can't nothing rewind us (I got ooh, grrr)
Time up, baby, fuck my mind up (yeah, she did)
You can't find her, pussy fuck my mind up (yeah, she did)
Fuck her spine up, somewhere they can't find us (they can't, ooh)
Toxic kind of, can't nothing rewind us (I got ooh, grrr)

So you sprung, right? (So you sprung right)
So you grown, right? (So you grown right)
You ain't dumb, right? (You ain't dumb right)
Your ex a bum, right?? (Your ex a boom)
You want me to go deep in your lungs right?
If she freaky just like me, it's a long night

You watch porn, right? Trackhawk sex, we roaring pipes (Trackhawk, vroom)
Pussy bald, right? You wanna fuck my dog, right? (Fuck my dog)
Touch your heart, right? Say you like 'em dark, right? (Like 'em dark)
You like stars, right, Maybach fucking all night (ugh)

Hey, pussy peaking through them drawers, that lil' pussy looking (I see you)
Beat that pussy half to death (ugh ugh) leave that pussy gushing (ugh)
Bald head' baby pussy' bald head (pussy bald)
Stand up in it, leave it in her' give her frog legs (give her ugh-ugh)

Time up, baby, fuck my mind up (fuck my mind up)
You can't find her, pussy fuck my mind up (fuck my head up)
Fuck her spine up, somewhere they can't find us (they can't find)
Toxic kind of, can't nothing rewind us (can't re-ooh, grrr)
Time up, baby, fuck my mind up (yeah, she did)
You can't find her, pussy fuck my mind up (yeah, she did)
Fuck her spine up, somewhere they can't find us
Toxic kind of, can't nothing rewind us (grrr)

Gangsta Grizzillz (grrr)
Shout out lil' ma from Memphis
She can play ratchet, she can play bougie
She know her way around in all the right places (grrr)
