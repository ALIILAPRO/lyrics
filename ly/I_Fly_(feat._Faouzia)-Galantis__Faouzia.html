		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been waitin' my whole life
To feel the love inside my bones, yeah
It's closer to hopeless and happiness ain't far from home, oh

Oh, I can't believe it
Oh, I can't believe it
Oh, I can't believe it

I've been feelin' for my li-life, yeah
I'm crashin' through the ceilin' and I wanna fly, fly, fly, yeah
Ooh, don't try, try, try, yeah
Let me make me feel it, yeah
I'm gonna fly, fly, fly, yeah

Emotions are foreign, yeah
But when we speak, I understand
I'm unbroken and over, yeah
Love exactly who I am, oh

Oh, I can't believe it
Oh, I can't believe it
Oh, I can't believe it

I've been feelin' for my li-life, yeah
I'm crashin' through the ceilin' and I wanna fly, fly, fly, yeah
Ooh, don't try, try, try, yeah
Let me make me feel it, yeah
I'm gonna fly, fly, fly, yeah

There's an earthquake in my soul
When your lightning crosses mine
Got me higher than my hopes tonight
There's an earthquake in my soul
When your lightning crosses mine
Got me higher than my hopes tonight

I've been feelin' for my li-life, yeah
I'm crashin' through the ceilin' and I wanna fly, fly, fly, yeah
Ooh, don't try, try, try, yeah
Let me make me feel it, yeah
I'm gonna fly, fly, fly, yeah

Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna fly, fly, fly, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I'm gonna fly, fly, fly, yeah
