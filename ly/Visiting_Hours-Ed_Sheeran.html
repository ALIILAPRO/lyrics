		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish that heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you

Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favorite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation? I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right

Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me, and make it on my own

And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away
