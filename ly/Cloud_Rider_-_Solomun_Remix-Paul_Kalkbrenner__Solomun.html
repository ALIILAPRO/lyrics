		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

With this true love I found
Picks my feet up off the ground to fly away
With this true love my dear
Takes away my every fear, don't go away
Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud

You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

I'm ridin' on a cloud
Got to shout it out loud, you're my all
Baby, hold on tight
For the rest of my life, don't let me fall
Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

You're the one

You're the one

You just don't know what you did to me
But I'm not the same
Since you gave me love
That's sheltered from the rain I'm not the same
Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me

Bustin' up on a cloud, shout out loud
You're the one for me
With your love by my side
The world will be mine
You're the one for me
