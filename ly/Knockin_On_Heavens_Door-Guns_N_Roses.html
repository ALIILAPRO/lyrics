		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, eh yeah

Ooh, oh, oh yeah
Oh yeah

Mama put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That cold black cloud is comin' down
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, oh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, eh, eh yeah

(You just better start sniffin' your own rank subjugation jack)
('Cause it's just you against your tattered libido)
(The bank and the mortician)
(Forever man and it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive)

Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door 
Hey, hey, hey, yeah (knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door)
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Ooh, yeah (knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door)
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
(Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door)
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
(Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door)
Whoa-whoa, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, oh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, wow oh yeah
