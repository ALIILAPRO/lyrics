		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody wanna say shit
I don't care about what they say about us now
Yeah, I don't wanna have no conversation
They just wanna fuck it all up now, yeah

And I like, I like bad bitches, mad riches
If you ain't one hunnid then you can't sit with us
No, you can't sit with us
I like bad bitches, mad riches
If you ain't one hunnid then you can't sit with us

Everybody swear they know 'bout us
But you only know what I told you
You only know what I showed you
Done lost too many soldiers
Put my hands up
We only get older, and only get older
No, you can't sit with us

I like bad bitches, mad riches
If you ain't one hunnid then you can't sit with us
No, you can't sit with us
I like bad bitches, mad riches
If you ain't one hunnid then you can't sit with us
