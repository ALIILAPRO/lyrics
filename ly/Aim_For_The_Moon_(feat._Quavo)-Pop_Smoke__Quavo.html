		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah) shoot for the stars (haha, woo), aim for the moon
You ain't cool (I'm feelin' treeshy), 'til I say you woo
Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (oh), yeah, yeah (I'm on Venus)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (that's why I say woo)
Yeah, yeah, are you dumb? Look (ooh)

You don't know what you started, I pop a perc', go retarded (oh)
I got the drip, it came straight from the faucet
Mr. Dior-Dior, they know where it started, yeah (oh)
She wanna Netflix and chill, fuck off the pill
Go in the store, shop at Dior (oh)
Come to my crib, take all my shirts
Pop all my percs and sleep in my drawers
You talkin' too much, baby, pour up a four
We both bust a nut, now leave me alone
When we in Miami, we stay at the Mondrian (oh)
We pull up to LIV in the Cullinan
Welcome her to the party
The after party's after party, then party again (oh)
A hunnid bitches, hardly any men (oh)
In my room is where the party began
Then take a flight to Bora Bora, it's time to catch a tan, look (woo)
It's still free all my niggas that's sentenced, stuck up in the jail (free all my niggas, yeah)
I could show you how to vibe, but I can't be ya man (can't be ya man)
Uh-huh (no, no, no, yeah)

Shoot for the stars (shoot, shoot, shoot)
Aim for the moon (the moon)
You ain't cool (you ain't cool) 
'Til I say you cool
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (skrrt-skrrt), yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (skrrt-skrrt), yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (skrrt-skrrt), yeah, yeah

Yeah, Pop Smoke the woo (Pop)
I play with the check and it's blue (blue)
We mobbin' and tied, no shoe (tie)
You play with the group, we gon' shoot (shoot)
He in Dior, I'm in Prada (Prada)
We rich, we came from the bottom (rich)
I'm a Migo, I feel like a doctor (Migo)
Goin' surgical with the new chopper (grrah)
Five hundred thousand, I'm in flex mode (yeah)
We got all the work, we make your trap close (trap)
Gang havin' loyalty, we ten toes (ten)
Nah, nobody givin' up, why would the gang fold? (Ooh)
We outside, we totin' them bangers, we not shootin' at strangers (we outside)
Say what you wanna say, long as it ain't us 'cause my niggas gon' hang ya (grrah)
Look at them young niggas goin' crazy-crazy, man, them niggas too dangerous (crazy)
We gonna make 'em famous, the beautiful country got stars and bangers (stars)

Shoot for the stars 
Aim for the moon
You ain't cool 
'Til I say you cool

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
