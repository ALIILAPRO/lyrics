		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey hey hey! Mr. Hangman
Go get your rope

Your daughters weren't careful,
I fear that I am a slippery slope
Now even if I lay my head down at night
After a day I got perfectly right

She won't know
She won't know
She won't know

So pray, little Kay, love's God on a good day.
And you can't blame your mother,
She's trying not to see you as her worst mistake
And I wish that I could tell you right now, that I love you
But it looks like I won't be around
So you won't know

You won't know
You won't know
You won't know

So believe in me,
Believe that you think I'll let you down
Well I won't
They can fire everything they've got
And when you think I'm sunk
I will float on and on
I have burned the bush that covered my light
And now I'm scared I won't burn that bright

But you won't know
You won't know
You won't know

You're never going to feel as full as you felt
So let's go outside and we'll play William Tell
Take your time drawing your bead
I'll stand as still as you need
'Cause you're so good at talking smack,
You heart attack
But you're the apple of my eye anyway

My smiling face, it's on your plate, it's on a silver plate

So they say,
They say in heaven
There's no husbands and wives
On the day that I show up
They'll be completely out
Of their forgiveness supplies
And I cant use the telephone
To tell you that I'm dead and gone
So you won't know

You won't know
You won't know
You won't know
