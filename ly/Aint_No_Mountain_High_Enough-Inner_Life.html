		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen baby, ain't no mountain high, 
Ain't no valley low, ain't no river wide enough; 
Baby if you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
Remember the day I set you free
I told you you could always count on me
From that day on, I made a vow,
I'll be there when you want me,
Some way, some how.
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
My love is alive
Way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand,
I'll be there on the double
As fast as I can.
Don't you know that there
 
Ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
 
No wind no rain or winters cold can stop me baby,
'Cause you are my goal.
If you're ever in trouble;
I'll be there on the double.
Just send for me, oh baby.
 
If you need me call me no matter where you are, 
No matter how far;
Just call my name; I'll be there in a hurry;
You don't have to worry,
 
'Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough 
To keep me from getting to you babe.
