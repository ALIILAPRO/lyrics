		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the days go into the thousands
The relentlessness grows
A longing with nothing to long for
Oblivious to what the future brings

Caught in a state of lethargy
Days go by outside the window
But inside, things are standing still
Everyday life has stagnated

Come save me out of this
Save me from myself
On the verge of breaking down
My mind is keeping me imprisoned

On hold, waiting, pacing the floor
A dull ache inhabits my core
If I just knew what to do
Time wouldn't be wasted like this

Caught in a state of lethargy
Days go by outside the window
But inside, things are standing still
Everything has come to a stop

Can't go to sleep
There's something that's missing
Something I haven't accomplished
And when I wake, it might be too late
Please, don't tell me it's too late

Come save me out of this
Save me from myself
On the verge of breaking down
My mind is keeping me imprisoned

Come save me out of this
Save me from myself
This can't go on any longer
My mind is keeping me imprisoned
