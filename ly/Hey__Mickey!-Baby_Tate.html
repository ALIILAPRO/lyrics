		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You don't know, you don't know the pain, man)
Hey, Mickey (hey, Mickey, hey, Mickey, hey, Mickey)

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you, uh-uh
Oh, oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind

Met this boy named Mickey, he had on some yellow Dickies
I knew he was a ho because his neck had hella hickies
I said "It's nice to meet you," shook his hand and it was sticky
I looked into his eyes and then, that's when it hit me, I said
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind
I just might let you come into my life and waste my time
I don't see no other man, boy, you done turned me blind
You make me deaf 'cause I believe you even when you lyin'

Never met a nigga like this (never met a nigga like this)
Make a bitch wanna cash in all her chips (wanna cash in all her chips)
Tell my friends "I'll see ya later, girl, I gotta dip" (I'll see ya later, girl, I gotta dip)
'Cause I got a meeting with a man named dick (meeting with a man named dick)

But I call him Richard, he's richer than Bill Gates
Gets me wetter than Superior Lake
Takes me on hundred-thousand-dollar dates
And I don't even have to give him cake
He just call me baby, he don't call me Tate
He whip up that white girl, he beatin' on Kate
I just might marry that nigga today
But then I found out that Mickey was gay, uh

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind
Oh, oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine, so fine, you blow my mind

Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey, hey, Mickey
