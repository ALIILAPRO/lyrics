		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, ah 
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

The sky is a neighborhood
So keep it down
Heart is a storybook
A star burned out

The sky is a neighborhood
Don't make a sound
Lights comin' up ahead
Don't look now

The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
Don't look now

Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Mind is a battlefield
All hope is gone
Trouble to the right and left
Whose side you're on?

Thoughts like a minefield
I'm a tickin' bomb
Maybe you should watch your step
Don't get lost

The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
The sky is a neighborhood (ah, ah)
Don't get lost

Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood

Heart is a storybook
A star burned out
Somethin' comin' up ahead
Don't look now

Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

Oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

(The sky is a neighborhood) oh, my dear, heaven is a big bang now
Gotta get to sleep somehow (the sky is a neighborhood)
Bangin' on the ceiling
Bangin' on the ceiling
Keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood
