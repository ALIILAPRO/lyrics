		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't turn me off

Yeah (yeah)
Like this (like this)
Where you at, shawty?

You fly as hell, swagger right, brown skin poppin'
You know just how to talk to me, know just how I like it
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on
Now wait a minute, lil' buster
You got one more time to feel on my booty
Better recognize a lady, that ain't the way you do me
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

Ah-ah-ah-ah
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas, give it to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman

Pullin' up on it, you actin' like you want it
And you stuntin' like your daddy, checkin' for this little mama
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on
Now, wait a minute, lil' buster
Now, you don't even know me but you wanna take me shoppin'
You a lame, I can tell that there ain't big shit poppin'
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

All you wanna do is holler at the cutest broad
To get up in them drawers
Got money, don't try to buy me bottles
Got my own dollars
I could buy up the bar if I wanted

Ah-ah-ah-ah
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas, give it to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ahem)
Recognize a real woman (ha)

I'm fly as hell, swagger right, brown skin poppin' like dynamite
Raw like China white, mama, I
Dig your persona, right, you look baby mama-type
I know that got you kinda hype, my ice is albino-white
I hope your vagina tight, I go underwater and
I hope your piranha bite, hahaha
Hot Carter, I'ma kiss the spot for you
And I'ma kiss it 'til you scream, wait a minute, motherfucker, ha
Yeah, I turn you on like a handle
Like a television on the Weather Channel
'Cause I make it rain, girl, now call me Wayne, girl
You just an earthling, you ain't never been to Wayne's World
I play to win, I bait 'em in
I do my thing, now, you're in love with an alien
Polow on the beat, and Weezy F, I'm at the plate again
Keri, if you pitch it at me, I'ma swing away at it
Someone better play the fence, someone better tell 'em 'bout me
Baby, I'm the shit, and that's the only thing you smell around me
Weezy F Baby, don't forget the F around me
And if you do, then get the F from 'round me

You're turnin' me off (haha)
Yeah, yeah
Polow, I told you, I got you
Ms. Keri, baby (Ms. Keri, baby)

Ah-ah-ah-ah
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas, give it to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I gotta be feelin' your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman

Hahaha
Yeah
Ms. Keri, baby
And Young Weezy, baby
It's Young Mula, baby
Hahaha
Ayo, keep all my vocals too, Polow, man, don't mute nothin' out
Yeah, hahaha
Yeah
