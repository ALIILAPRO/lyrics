		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waking up, bottom of an empty cup
Laying in your favorite clothes chosen just for you
Make you laugh, maybe I could make you laugh
Books of faded photographs, moments saved for you
Angel dust, tiny little paper cuts
Close my eyes and feel your touch, holding on to you

Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now

Love and trust, life is just a game of luck 
All this time escaping us, until our time is through

Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
Rest, you can rest now
Rest, you will be safe now
You will be safe now

Waking up, had another dream of us
In the warm Virginia sun, there I will meet you
