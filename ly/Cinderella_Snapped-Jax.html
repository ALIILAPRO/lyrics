		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One upon a time there was a princess
Waiting for a boy to give back her shoe
Suck it in, suck it in, be a wife in a blue dress
The prettiest piece of property the land ever knew
She waited and she waited for the guy to show
But she didn't know that after midnight
He was busy in her stepsister's bed
So Cinderelly said, "Plot twist"

I don't need no prince to save me
I'm a goddamn CEO
Don't call me "Baby", equal pay me
Snow White said you tried to kiss her
So I'll just buy a new glass slipper and
Burn your castle down
And kids, that's how Cinderella snapped

When the smoke cleared, every girl in the whole land
Woke the fuck up and started making demands
Rapunzel shaved their head so there was nothin' to climb on
Jasmine made out with Mulan
Sleeping Beauty sued the dude who kissed her while she was asleep
And Ariel was confident without any feet
Tiana went and got a biomedical degree
And Beauty realized that she was the Beast

I don't need no prince to save me
I'm a goddamn CEO
Don't call me "Baby", equal pay me
Snow White said you tried to kiss her
So I'll just buy a new glass slipper and
Burn your castle down
And kids, that's how Cinderella snapped

He said, "Cindy, sweetie, don't be so emotional
You're always so emotional
It's fine to be controllable"
If I'm emotional, that'd be the reason for you to address me
While you're on your knees in the scary event
That I get too emotional during your trial
So watch how you're speaking
'Cause while you were sleeping around every weekend
And using your power to pray on the weakest
I studied your own legislation all season
And last I checked, cheating is treason

I don't need no prince to save me
I'm a goddamn CEO
Don't call me "Baby", equal pay me
Snow White said you tried to kiss her
So I'll just buy a new glass slipper and
Burn your castle down
And kids, that's how Cinderella snapped
