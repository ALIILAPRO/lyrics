		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a dream that you were mine
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times

I left my room on the west side
I walked from noon until the night
I changed my crowd, I ditched my tie
I watched the sparks fly off the fire
I found your house, I didn't even try
They'd closed the shutters, they'd pulled the blinds
My eyes were red, the streets were bright
Those ancient years were black and white

The 10th of November, the year's almost over
If I had your number, I'd call you tomorrow
If my eyes were open, I'd be kicking the doors in
But all that I have is this old dream I've always had

A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times

I left my room on the west side
I walked from noon through the night
I changed my crowd, I ditched my tie
I watched the sparks fly off the fire
I found your old house, I didn't even try
They'd closed the shutters, they'd pulled the blinds
I had a dream that you were mine
I've had that dream a thousand times

But I don't answer questions, I just keep on guessing
My eyes are still open, the curtains are closing
But all that I have is this old dream I must have had

A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
A thousand times, a thousand times
I've had that dream a thousand times
