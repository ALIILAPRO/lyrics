		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, used to drink so much mud, I mud walk
Ayy, fuck a rider with a pop
Better yet I just hit the plug like say "wassup"
Ayy, outta place for the blunt
Peep my steez lil' bitch like peep my drip, aye don't say no shit
You got to pop soul, I lose bad
Glock 45, my tool man
Aye stabbed in the back, sneaky bitches from the net
Fuck nigga best grab a tool or TEC
'Cause hoe, oh yeah this bitch stretched, ayy, oh yes, this bitch stretched
Listen I was ducked down from depression
Now my heart fell from my chest
And if I sell it must be honest, I was tossed from an abyss
I got the crust of your bitch lips, up on my dick, no counterfeit
In LA was stuck in traps, now I got 12 thousand on my fist
Toss of that dick watch her juggle it
Walked in, I made it uncomfortable
Your career simply a stepping stool
Playing like chess, will she bend and move, ooh
I can get lost in the groove, I'm known to dead out the moon
I'm rising dead with the moon, can't see my flesh what is you
Therefore we brought the mad tools
Chopped out the doors of the coupe
Therefore we brought the mad tools
Chopped out the doors of the coupe
Therefore we brought the mad tools
Chopped out the doors of the coupe

Hold up like, diamonds VVS's
My shit thick like Texas, bring it back
Your bitch in my mentions, dump that shit and exit
Please break away my connection, hold up like
Please break away my connection, hold up like
Please break away my connection, bring it back
Please break away my connection
Hold up like, diamonds VVS's
My shit thick like Texas, bring it back
Your bitch in my mentions, dump that shit and exit
Please break away my connection, hold up like
Please break away my connection, hold up like
Please break away my connection, bring it back
Please break away my connection, hold up like
