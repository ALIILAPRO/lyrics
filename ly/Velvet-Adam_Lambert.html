		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feelin' nostalgic
I know that I'm not the only one
I think it's time for a throwback
To remind me how to fall in love

Wanna rock something in my own kinda way
Like it's tailor-made for me
Think I found someone I can get lost in
Cut from the same cloth as me

Just like velvet
And I knew, and I knew it was cool the first time I felt it
I got that feeling tonight
Be my velvet
'Cause I can't get enough of your touch, I'm crushin'
I got that feelin', I, I got that feelin' tonight

I've been craving a classic, ok, baby
That vintage '79
These trends are gettin' too tragic
So come over put your skin next to mine

Wanna rock something in my own kinda way
Like it's tailor-made for me
Think I found someone I can get lost in
Cut from the same cloth as me

Just like velvet
And I knew, and I knew it was cool the first time I felt it
I got that feeling tonight
Be my velvet
'Cause I can't get enough of your touch, I'm crushin'
I got that feelin', I, I got that feelin' tonight
I got that feelin' tonight (I got that feelin' tonight)

Wanna rock something in my own kinda way
Like it's tailor-made for me
Think I found someone I can get lost in
Cut from the same cloth as me

Just like velvet
And I knew, and I knew it was cool the first time I felt it
I got that feeling tonight
Be my velvet
'Cause I can't get enough of your touch, I'm crushin'
I got that feelin', I, I got that feelin' tonight
I, I got that feelin' tonight
I got that feelin' tonight
I got that feelin' tonight (got that feelin' tonight)
I got that feelin' tonight
