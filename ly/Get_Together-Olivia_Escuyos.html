		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a minute
Tell me everything you've been missing
And the in between shit
I've been climbing yeah
Doing my own thing
And I know you see it
Yeah
Just got back from Atlanta
So you better turn up
Better give me some love
No one knows me like you do
Been through it all
Right from the start
Yeah
I love
Love when we get together
No one
Makes me feel better
Than you
I love
Love when we get together
No one makes me feel the way you do
Yeah
And every time I came back
It's like I never left
Fucked with me
Because I was different
And you knew that
Out of sight
But you ain't out my mind
No
And i can't forget the way
You put it down on me
You ain't mine but tonight
You're gonna be yeah
Sade and Marvin Gaye
You know what it is
on the radio
I love
Love when we get together
No one
Makes me feel better
Than you
I love
Love when we get together
No one makes me feel the way you do
Yeah
