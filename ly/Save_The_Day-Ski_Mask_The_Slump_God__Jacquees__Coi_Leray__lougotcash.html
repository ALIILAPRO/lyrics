		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pull up and save the day
Don't want any problems, I'll be a call away
I'm ready for action, fly without a cape
I'm one of those ones, they'll never beat me, they'll never beat me

'Kay, okay how could I forget? Ayy
It takes some courage to bet, ayy
That must be why you in debt
You take the bait and get caught in the net, ayy
Evil will never prevail, suckers
What is real will never fail to prosper
Came from the ground to the top, helicopter
I go hard just like the shell of a lobster
They all missin' the message
All of these people sayin' that they want the treasure
Careful of the wishes you make up on your blessings
Because the devil in you is plottin' against you
And you'll find that your worst enemy is within you
You could still be adopted even though you a sibling
I'ma paint a vivid picture for all the children
It's about time that we change how we livin', I get my prints in the ceilin'

I pull up and save the day
Don't want any problems, I'll be a call away
I'm ready for action, fly without a cape
I'm one of those ones, they'll never beat me, they'll never beat me

Yeah, look at the way I take off
I gotta stay focused and shoot for the stars
I got 'em on watch and they know where we are
I know where I'm headed, yeah I'm goin' far
Yeah I'm goin' hard and they ain't gon' stop me
It's me and my friends and I know that they got me
We levelin' up, goin' up like a rocket
We savin' the day and nobody gon' knock
Yeah we all the heroes, can't get with the fake
I been through a lot, had a lot on my plate
Got no fear in my heart 'cause I know that I'm brave (nah, nah)
Never gave up, kept my head in the game
You gotta just trust me and lemme come guide you
If you ever get lost, then I'll come back and find you
I think they forgot so I had to remind 'em
Climb all the way to the top like a spider (yeah)

I pull up and save the day
Don't want any problems, I'll be a call away
I'm ready for action, fly without a cape
I'm one of those ones, they'll never beat me, they'll never beat me

Look, I pull up and save the day
I gotta do that in a major way (ooh, ooh)
Who gon' get saved today?
You callin' my phone, just a page away (brr, brr)
You can call me, you can beep me (ring)
'Cause I promise you that nobody could beat me (yeah)
I know everything there is that you could teach me (hey)
On a bad day, a villain can't defeat me (ooh)
Don't sign up (Yeah) for this contract (no)
You don't want that, you don't want the contact (don't want the contact)
I'm on a building, you better get your hard hat (yeah)
Everybody gotta fear when there's combat (hey)
Let 'em stand up, good, bring 'em to (ooh, ooh)
Have you hangin' off a web, I could save too (yeah)
That's what I do, you relate to
When I pull up, everybody pray through

I pull up and save the day
Don't want any problems, I'll be a call away
I'm ready for action, fly without a cape
I'm one of those ones, they'll never beat me, they'll never beat me
