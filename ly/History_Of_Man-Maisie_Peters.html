		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tale as old as honey
A moment everybody knows
Yeah, I'm sure there was heartbreak
Inside the walls of Jericho
I couldn't believe it
How you could just stop wanting me
You burnt down Easter Island
As if it wasn't sacred, as if it wasn't sacred to me

I've seen it in the poems and the sands
I've pleaded with the powers and their plans
I tried to rewrite it but I can't
It's the history, the history of man
She stays up, he's sleeping like a lamb
She begs him, he says he doesn't understand
She loves him more than anyone ever has
In the history, the history of man
It's the history of man (yep)

You didn't even falter
Didn't look back once, did you?
So Samson blamed Delilah
But given half the chance I
I would've made him weaker too
Sirens sounded, trumpets blaring
You walked out, oh, without sweating

I've seen it in the poems and the sands
I've pleaded with the powers and their plans
I tried to rewrite it but I can't
It's the history, the history of man
She stays up, he's sleeping like a lamb
She begs him, he says he doesn't understand
She loves him more than anyone ever has
In the history (history), the history of man

He stole her youth and promised heaven
The men start wars yet Troy hates Helen
Women's hearts are lethal weapons
Did you hold mine and feel threatened?
Hear my lyrics, taste my venom
You are still my great obsession

I've seen it in the poems and the sands
I've pleaded with the powers and their plans
I tried to rewrite it but I can't
It's the history (history), the history of man
I stay up, you're sleeping like a lamb
I beg you and you don't understand
I hold on, I try to hold your hand
I save you a seat and then you say you want to stand
So you'll lose me, the best you'll ever have
It's the history, the history of man
