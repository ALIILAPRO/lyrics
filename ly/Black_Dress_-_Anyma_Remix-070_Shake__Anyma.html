		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

I, I imagined you just like a fantasy
And I, intertwined with you, create a color scheme
Remember
Try to remember you, but you're like a dying dream
Time talks like you know what I mean

Even when it's dark out
I still could see your bone structure
I could see the light in you
Even when it's dark out
I still could see your bone structure
I could see the light in you, ooh

My baby was in a black dress when she married me
I'm the reason that you walk that way in your two inch heels

Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

I wish the world did you better
So I could see you
I drove past heaven
We're high (so high), we're see through
And they won't understand
You see my light even when they say I'm bad for you
You still swam
We didn't drown even when the waves crashed on us

Even when it's dark out
I still could see your bone structure
I could see the light in you
Even when it's dark out
I still could see your bone structure
I could see the light in you, ooh

My baby was in a black dress when she married me
I'm the reason that you walk that way in your two inch heels

Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na

My baby was in a black dress when she married me
I'm the reason that you walk that way in your two inch heels
My baby was in a black dress when she married me
I'm the reason that you walk that way in your two inch heels
