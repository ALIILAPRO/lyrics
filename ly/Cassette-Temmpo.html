		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bobby pins everywhere
And I can still smell your hair
Like a phantom fragrance
Yeah, we had no patience
On the back of these leather seats
Yeah, that's where you said to me
"If you want it, just take it"
I can still hear you say it

Stay here just a little bit, little bit, little bit longer
Let's move just a little bit, little bit, little bit slower
Your mixtape on the stereo, stereo, pulling us closer
You left me last summer with nothing but your number
And an old cassette (ooh, ooh)
And an old cassette, hey (ooh, ooh)

Yeah, your song is stuck in my head
And I keep rewinding it with a number two pencil
Yeah, I'm lost in these headphones
Every track is a memory of your hands all over me
Every time that I play it, I can still hear you saying

Stay here just a little bit, little bit, little bit longer
Let's move just a little bit, little bit, little bit slower
Your mixtape on the stereo, stereo, pulling us closer
You left me last summer with nothing but your number
And an old cassette (ooh, ooh)
And an old cassette, oh (ooh, ooh)

Maybe we were too young to know that expression
Bright stars burn out fast, that's why we couldn't last
In the heat of summer, yeah, you took me under
I've never been the same 'cause I still hear you say

Stay here just a little bit, little bit, little bit longer
Let's move just a little bit, little bit, little bit slower
Your mixtape on the stereo is still pulling me under
Those summer nights I can't forget
Every time I play your old cassette
