		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It doesn't hurt to hurt a little
Least ‘till everybody feels that they're saved
You can bite the hand that feeds you
You can walk on by like a public spy in a cage

[Chorus]
Woah… nothing can wait
Woah… nothing can wait

Radiate defenceless
Like some charmed out relic from another ice age
We're going up through the roof
And I know, I know, I know it's getting late, oh

Woah… nothing can wait
Woah… nothing can wait

See the higher the ground
The deeper the whole
We couldn't wait to be found
As if you didn't already know, oh
That nothing can wait

You're colliding with the couch too long
And now your face is glowin' red
You've been talkin' like a fish
Don't wanna be a critic
Don't even want to catch your breath, no

Woah
Nothing can wait

You see the higher the ground
The deeper the whole
We won't wait to be found
Somehow we already know, oh
Too many faces in this crowd
So so far to go, oh
When nothing can wait

[Music]

And the clouds are gonna break tonight
The clouds are gonna break tonight
Night falls down and breaks daylight
Where nothing can wait

And the clouds are gonna break tonight
The clouds are gonna break tonight
Nothing can wait tonight
Nothing can wait
