		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuckin' on bitches, I do what I do
Backshot, backshot, you and your crew
Fuckin' on bitches, I do what I do
Huh, huh, huh, switch

Uh-huh-uh, uh
I told her I don't really need her (uh-huh, need her)
Where was you at when I was in the field? (Where?)
You played the bleachers (uh-huh)
I fucked on her friend but we wasn't involved 
So I ain't cheater (uh-huh)
By the sideline with my side bitch 
Hope the jumbotron don't see us (don't see us)
Dodgin' the- (fuck)
GLS (yes)
I'm rich, got me an AP 
So I ain't got time for your PMS (uh-huh)
Ain't got the time for no B-N-S
Tell me your problems and see 'em out
I'm makin' 'em salty, salty, salty

Ayy, salt shaker (salt shaker)
She gon' shake, shake, shake what her momma gave her (what her momma gave her)
I'm her throat coat 
In her mouth like Now N Laters (like a Now N Later)
That nigga ho far gone
Don't you try to save her (try to save her)
Like defibrillators ('fibrillators)

Ayy, we ain't fuckin' no more, she a hasbeen
The head ain't no point, need a aspirin (mhm)
Fuck the front, came in through the back end (through the back end)
Fuck around and meet me with the back end (with the back end)
Used to get the pack in, I was taxin' (taxin')
Uncle Sam on the block, what happened? (What happened?)
Had a wide open shot and he choked
That's why he don't drill with me no more (brrt)
Had the nerve to tell me she don't give throat (she don't give-)
What? Kick the bitch out on the road (bye)
Big dog, make her do it on all fours
Mike Jones in the cut, on four fours
They put a nigga in cuffs, or the fo-fo
Middle finger, that's a fuck to the popo
In between, tryna get my nut 
These hoes I lust, No hoes we trust (trust, trust, trust, trust)

Uh-huh-uh, uh
I told her I don't really need her (uh-huh, need her)
Where was you at when I was in the field? (Where?)
You played the bleachers (uh-huh)
I fucked on her friend but we wasn't involved 
So I ain't cheater (uh-huh)
By the sideline with my side bitch 
Hope the jumbotron don't see us (don't see us)
Dodgin' the- (fuck)
GLS (yes)
I'm rich, got me an AP 
So I ain't got time for your PMS 
Ain't got the time for no B-N-S
Tell me your problems and see 'em out
I'm makin' 'em salty, salty, salty
