		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had to gamble my life
I'm rollin' the dice
My name got a price, but talk to me nice
I got my money right
And now they criticize, but it's alright
I won't be victimized
Judgin' the police takin' my people lives
I'm just signin' checks and doin' what's best for mine
And ain't gotta do too much 'cause real gon' recognize
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)

It's written on your face, like you better than me
I can't get caught up with you bitches, I'm keeping' it P
You gotta keep it P
My millennium is the last dying breed (oh yeah, oh yeah)
Louis on me, my arms strong and you too skinny and scrawny
You don't tell no lies then I can fuck with you only
I turn you up and you gon' never be lonely (yeah)
I want a Rolls-Royce, I want a Maybach
I want a Hellcat,cost a hunnid racks
You sold a lot of cap, they want they money back
I toured across the map, thank God I made it back
I never asked for help, nobody gave me that
We 'boutta ban all that cap, we only stating facts
I'ma let 'em know how I feel, check out my latest track
And I always stay on track (yeah, yeah-yeah)

I'm killin' 'bout my brother, and I know that you see
My new house didn't come with a key, you gotta type it and see
Fuck your whole gang, we smoked the boss
We ain't smokin' no leaf
We shop online in vintage store
Got thousand-dollar tees
We passed the bitch right when we done
She ain't my wife, how could I see her with my son?
Rockin' Rick Owens, got the ones that say, "Cunt"
All I do is sit and count racks up by the bunch
Took her out and paid for lunch
Rich off of Pyrex, you can twirl your arm right to left and get a Corvette
5 or 6 M, the LaFerrari, I don't know what I started
I told my teacher I'ma buy more watches 'cause I was tardy
I started screamin' out the answers before it started
Added that bitch to my ransom, then went the hardest
My homie died, I want answers, so we gon' spark it
We takin' over like cancer and goin' the hardest

Had to gamble my life
Rollin' the dice
My name got a price, so talk to me nice
I got my money right
And now they criticize, but it's alright
I won't be victimized
Judgin' the police takin' my people lives
I'm just signin' checks and doin' what's best for mine
And ain't gotta do too much 'cause real gon' recognize
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
