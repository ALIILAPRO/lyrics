		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby
Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby

Please, come down so we can get out
I've waited too long to get your voice out of my head
(Out of my head) out of my head (out of my head)
Feels like home, I'm covered in stone
I know you'll think twice, I'm waiting by the window, babe
(Window, babe) window, babe (window, babe)

Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby
Too many, too many things we did together
You used to promise me it would be forever
Feeling like the end, don't think it will get better, baby
