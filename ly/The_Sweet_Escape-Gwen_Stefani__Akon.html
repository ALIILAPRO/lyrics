		  Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo

If I could escape
I would, but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting, stinking, treating you this way
'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (escape)
And recreate a place as my own world (own world)
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl, I try, I try)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(Whatsoever) we can make it better
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (to our sweet escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (yeah) yee hoo

You held me down
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground

So, baby, times getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Wait on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way the you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me
Want to take you with me

If I could escape (escape)
And recreate a place as my own world (own world)
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl, I try, I try)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(Whatsoever) we can make it better
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, (if I could escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (if I could escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo

'Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold

If I could escape (escape)
And recreate a place as my own world (own world)
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet? (Sweet escape)

If I could be sweet (be sweet)
I know I've been a real bad girl (bad girl, I try, I try)
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
(Whatsoever) we can make it better
And tell me, boy, now wouldn't that be sweet?
(Sweet escape, sweet escape)

Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (to our sweet escape) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (I wanna get away) yee hoo
Woo hoo, (yeah) yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
Woo hoo, yee hoo
