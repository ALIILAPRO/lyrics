		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing in a crowded room
But all I see is you
Like a spotlight follows where you are

Do you know I never want to leave your side
Desire swallows up my pride
I can't say no, I want you,
So I've got to see this through

'Cause I just can't fight this feeling
We should be lovers. We should be lovers
No I just can't fight this feeling
We should be lovers. We should be lovers
Now I just can't fight this feeling
My head is spinning. I think its winning
Now I just can't fight this feeling
And it's beating me down

Falling on you took a moment
Your kiss charged my heart
Just a touch could never be enough

Do you I know I'm overboard and can't be saved?
I pray the night time makes me brave
I have to show I want you
So I've got to get to you

'Cause I just can't fight this feeling
We should be lovers. We should be lovers
No I just can't fight this feeling
We should be lovers. We should be lovers
Now I just can't fight this feeling
My head is spinning. I think its winning
Now I just can't fight this feeling
And it's beating me down

Why don't you, why don't you,
Why don't you come to me?
Why don't you, why don't you
Why don't you come to me?
