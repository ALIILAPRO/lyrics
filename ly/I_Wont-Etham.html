		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night I lose a little sympathy and it kills me
All I want is for you to hear me out, I'm not the enemy

Don't you know that we're on the same side
And all of your demons are mine

You pick your poison
Let it run deep
You do it in front of me
You don't even see it
When you can't walk straight
You're pushing my love away

But when they all leave, I'll show
And when you give up I won't

You say you're changing, you're different now
But you got your hands on the bottle
And you hurt yourself, you're hurting me
You're hurting everyone around you, can't you see?

Don't you know that we're on the same
And all of your demons are mine

You pick your poison
Let it run deep
You do it in front of me
You don't even see it
When you can't walk straight
You're pushing my love away

But when they all leave, I'll show
And when you give up I won't

And what hurts the most
You don't even notice
You don't even know
When I come running home
'Cause you've lost a friend 
'Cause you've done it again

And when they all leave, I'll show
When you give up I won't

'Cause you pick your poison
Let it run deep
You do it in front of me
You don't even see it
When you can't walk straight
You're pushing my love away

But when they all leave, I'll show
And when you give up I won't
