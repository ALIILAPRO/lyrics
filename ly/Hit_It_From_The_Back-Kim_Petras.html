		  Hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
I'll let you hit it from the back
Before you break my heart
Before you break my heart
Hit it from the-

Back in my room, dreamin' 'bout you
I got a feeling you know what to do
How will you kiss? Where will you bite?
I got a feeling we'll find out tonight

(Ooh) You and I could be in paradise
(Yeah) You and I, yeah, we could own the world
(Ooh) You and I don't gotta live a lie
(Yeah) Baby, I'ma let you 

Hit it from the back
Hit it from the back
I'll let you hit it from the back
Before you break my heart (my heart)
Before you break my heart (my heart, heart)
Hit it from the-

Back of the car, under the stars
Don't be too easy when I want it hard
I'll be your girl 'til morning light
You gotta please me and last through the night

(Ooh) You and I could be in paradise
(Yeah) You and I, yeah, we could own the world
(Ooh) You and I don't gotta live a lie
(Yeah) Baby, I'ma let you 

Hit it from the (back)
Yeah, yeah 
I'll let you hit it from the back (ooh)
Before you break my heart (my heart)
Before you break my heart (my heart)

I'll let you hit it from the back (baby, baby, baby, baby)
Hit it from the back (you know I'll let you)
I'll let you hit it from the back (before you break my heart, baby)
Before you break my heart (my heart)
Before you break my heart (my heart, heart)
Hit it from the back
