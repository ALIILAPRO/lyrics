		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair

One child grows up to be
Somebody that just loves to learn
And another child grows up to be
Somebody you'd just love to burn

Mom loves the both of them
You see, it's in the blood
Both kids are good to mom
Blood's thicker than the mud

It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Over there, over there

Newlywed a year ago
But you're still checking each other out, hey
Nobody wants to blow
Nobody wants to be left out, uh huh
You can't leave, 'cause your heart is there
But, sure, you can't stay, 'cause you been somewhere else
You can't cry 'cause you'll look broke down
But you're cryin' anyway 'cause you're all broke down

It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
Oh, hey, a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair

It's a family affair (oh)
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair
It's a family affair

It's a family affair
It's a family affair
