		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go

Two hours conversation and I know
This isn't going nowhere, we both know
That every time we try, we try something new
We got back to the old habits that we knew

Another hour, 'nother question and you know
You already have the answer, we both know
That every time we try, we tried something new
We got back to the old habits that we knew

You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go, I'ma go

You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go, I'ma go

Now don't even try to put it on me
Find a better explanation for what you did
Maybe we're both to blame for what's going on
But now you're moving out and I'm moving on

Another hour, 'nother question and you know
You already have the answer, we both know
That every time we try, we tried something new
We got back to the old habits

You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go, I'ma go

You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go, I'ma go

Now wake up, no make-up, no more you and I
You cleared all the doubts in my mind (mmh)
No fake up, just make up your life and I'll make mine
I'll be much better in time

You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go, I'ma go

You know you did me wrong (mmh)
Just one more cup of coffee 'fore I go (mmh)
I know I better stop and cut the show (mmh)
I'll leave you all the memories and go, I'ma go, I'ma go
