		  I ain't got time
For a motherfucker that can't tell me the time
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve

Back to back Suburbans, Presidential, I been swervin' (swerve)
Boys be talkin' down but when they see me they be flirtin' (hah)
Couple hundred dollars on some bottles, see 'em circlin' (bussin')
Welcome to the party this the new Tay Money circus (Money)
We be in the club, we be dancin' we be twerkin' (ooh)
Heard you switched your style, I'm glad you did, it wasn't workin' (hah)
They be talkin' shit I spend this money because I earned it (bitch)
I be stackin' money it's as tall as Uzi Vert is (swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve)

I need a Maserati, park the Lexus I don't ride 'em (ooh)
Curtains in the Maybach, slide it over let the light in (yeah)
Twin turbos sound like thunder and lightnin' (Money)
I let him beat it up, so I call him Mike Tyson
I'm the Queen I been feenin' for that motherfuckin' paper (bougie)
I be out in LA like a motherfuckin' Laker
Don't invite him to the function 'cause I'm finna see him later (mm)
I'ma let him do his thing, I ain't no motherfuckin' hater
I'm like, nah, for real I get that money then I go up (yeah)
When I'm in the spot I get money just to show up (hey)
I'm like nah, for real, I bet they never thought I'd blow up
Okay bae go head pass me that bottle, let me pour up

Back to back Suburbans, Presidential, I been swervin' (swerve)
Boys be talkin' down but when they see me they be flirtin' (hah)
Couple hundred dollars on some bottles, see 'em circlin' (bussin')

They be talkin' shit I spend this money because I earned it (bitch)
I be stackin' money it's as tall as Uzi Vert is (swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve)

And I make these hoes mad 'cause I'm all up in my bag (uh-uh)
If you talkin' about some money where it's at? (Money)
I been gettin' to the cash, yeah, my pockets gettin' fat (Tay)
Bitch I'm really, really, really, in my bag (period)
Ayy, 'cause I been down, I'm up now
Your boyfriend tryna fuck now (boy)

'Cause I'm all that and then some
My bitch bad her ass done (ooh)

Like, "Where you from?"
Bitch, Athens (hey y'all)
