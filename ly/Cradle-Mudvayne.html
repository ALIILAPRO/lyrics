Puuuuuuuussssshhh
Puuuuuuuussssshhh
Puuuuuuuussssshhh
Puuuuuuuussssshhh

I lost you 
You were my god 
Thought what do I do now
You were never there for me 
Never there to carry me
26 years looking back that time is gone 
It was you I believed in
Look what you've done to me 
Realize what you've done to
Meeeeee!

I can't bleed
I can't bleed
I want to bleed
Before my life just walks away from me

I can't see going on, 
In this darkness I'm blind,
Beneath my cradle, the bough has broke,
I exorcise my loss, 
Your lies, punishment

It takes time 
To try to mend the wounds of all the suffering
What do I do now
And, all I'm asking from you please 
Send me a sign,
To guide me through the times that lie in front of me
I'll get by 
Myself

Look at me now, a piece of s*** like you!
Look at me now, you left me, so f*** you!
Look at me now, a piece of s*** like you!
Look at me now, you left me, so f*** you!

'cause, everybody leaves me
Everybody's gone.
Watch my father leave me 
There's nobody left.
Feels like I've never been loved!
Everybody leaves me 
Never gave a s*** about me.
Everybody's gone 
I'll rot in my head alone.

I don't give a f*** about you, go the f*** away
I don't give a f*** about you, go the f*** away
I don't give a f*** about you, go the f*** away
I don't give a f*** about you, go the f*** away
(I'll rot in my head all alone)

F***ing c***sucker

Fake being 
Inside of my heart you are the liar
Innocence displaced
Institutionalized in my own life
Been left.

Here I stand now and I'm alone
With no one to comfort me
One set of footprints in the sand
No one to take my hand, I'll
I'll walk through as long as I need
I'll drift through my life though I'm alone
Outgrown the cradle that once housed me
And I've found that all I need is
Meeee
Meeee
Meeee
Meeee

Found I've never needed you 
To push through
All the s*** that stacks up 
Inside of my life
Endless plight that circulates through my body
I'll keep stumbling
Beating
Pummeling
Teething on the rind and 
Renounce my being

I can't see going on
I can't see going on
I can't see going on
I can't see going on

I can't see
I'm to tired
I can't see
Well, I can't see goin' on
I'm so tired 
Of trying to mend the wounds of all my suffering
What do I do now
And, all I'm asking from you please
Send me a sign
To guide me through the times that lie in front of me
I'll get by 
Myself

I can't see going on, f*** it!
I can't see going on, f*** it!
I can't see going on, f*** it!
I can't see going on, f*** it!
