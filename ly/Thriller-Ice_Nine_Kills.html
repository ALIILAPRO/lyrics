		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark 
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart

You try to scream (scream)
But terror takes the sound before you make it
Yeah, yeah
You start to freeze (freeze)
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller (thriller), thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller (thriller), thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a 
Killer, thriller tonight

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun

You close your eyes (eyes)
And hope that this is just imagination
Yeah, yeah
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind (creeping up behind)
You're out of time

'Cause this is thriller (thriller), thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller (thriller), thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a 
Killer, thriller tonight (yeah)

Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour's close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

'Cause this is thriller (thriller), thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller (thriller), thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a 
Killer, thriller tonight

(The foulest stench is in the air)
(The funk of forty thousand years)
(And grisly ghouls from every tomb)
(Are closing in to seal your doom)
(And though you fight to stay alive)
(Your body starts to shiver)
(For no mere mortal can resist)
(The evil of the thriller)
