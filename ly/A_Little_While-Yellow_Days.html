		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's your definition of love?
Love
It's kinda like, you know, when you see a fog in the morning
When you wake up, before the sun comes out
It's just for a little while, and then it burns away

Broken by love
This hurt divides itself
Decided that kissing you is just bad for my health
So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say

Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while

I looked you right in your eyes
And asked you why it has to be this way
I don't know
And to my surprise, you did say
This is just you and I babe
You and I babe

Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while

So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say

Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh, don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
