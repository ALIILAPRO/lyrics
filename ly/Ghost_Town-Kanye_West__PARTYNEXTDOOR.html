		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I wanna wear a starry crown
Some day, some day
Some day I wanna lay down, like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on Sunday
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm
Some day, I wanna tell everybody, some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Each one, knowing how 'm livin', smokin' marijuana
Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna, some days

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone
And they'll pray, it's not enough
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what we had in mind
But maybe some day

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go (go), of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on the stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
