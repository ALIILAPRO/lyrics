		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel you, I can hear you, howling in my bones
There's an evil lurking in the dark (there's an evil lurkin' in the dark)
Ever shifting, skin is ripping, as you take control
I can't tell where you end and where I start (there's an evil lurkin' in the dark)

A ferocious diagnosis, under moonlit hands, will
The man become the monster or the monster become man?

I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed when the creature comes alive
'Cause it's fight or fright, in the full moonlight
You can run but you can't hide
I could be honest, I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
But no one can break my heart like I can
(Werewolf)

Bleed the neon from the bite marks, ever bittersweet
Smile for the camera but don't flash your teeth (everybody loves a mystery)
Let the bodies hit the dance floor to this heartbreak beat
I feel like somebody's watchin' me (feels like everybody's watchin' me)

Seductively destructive, we are true romance
Does the man become the monster or the monster become man?

I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed when the creature comes alive
'Cause it's fight or fright, in the full moonlight
You can run but you can't hide
I could be honest, I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
But you can't break my heart like I can

Can't fight these cravings in the night
A beast who's burdened by his bite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
(You can't break my heart like I can)
Can't fight these cravings in the night
Moonwalking, feed the appetite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
(No, you can't break my heart like I can)

And in the pale moonlight, a debt to be paid
For one must suffer for all eternity

Nothing lasts forever, even guilty pleasures, ah

I could be up all night, but I'm paralyzed when the creature comes alive
Don't wanna feel
I could be honest, I could be human
I could become the silver bullet in your head
Oh

Can't fight these cravings in the night
A beast who's burdened by his bite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
(No, you can't break my heart like I can)
Can't fight these cravings in the night
Moonwalking, feed the appetite
Can't fight these cravings in the night
(Werewolf)
