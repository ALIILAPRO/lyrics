		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night Nurse, nurse
Night Nurse, nurse

Its critical
'Cause your body's gonna rock just like a cannibal
Makes you bouncing around the block just like an outlaw
We're gonna take it too the top, twelve o'clock (that's it)
Guess who's on the night shift?

'Cause tonight I'm working over time
Oh are you ready to cross the line
I'll treat you until the break of dawn
You're not alone

Night nurse, nurse
Night nurse, nurse
(Who you gonna call?)
Night nurse, nurse
Night nurse, nurse
(Who you gonna call?)

Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, oh oh
I don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
Night nurse

Its physical
'Cause tonight were gonna party on the top floor
Elevate you there
And I don't care if it all comes natural
Your medical prescription, baby get ready now
This is my religion

'Cause tonight I'm working over time
Oh are you ready to cross the line
I'll treat you until the break of dawn
You're not alone

Night nurse, nurse
Night nurse, nurse
(Who you gonna call?)
Night nurse, nurse
Night nurse, nurse
(Who you gonna call?)

Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, oh oh
I don't wanna be your lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
Night nurse

I am not the enemy, I cold be your remedy
I am not the enemy, let me be your remedy

It's critical
'Cause your body's gonna rock just like and outlaw
Who you gonna call?
It's physical
'Cause tonight we gonna party on the top floor, party on the top floor

Night nurse, nurse
Night nurse, nurse
(Who you gonna call?)
Night nurse, nurse
Night nurse, nurse
(Who you gonna call?)

Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, oh oh
Don't wanna be your lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
