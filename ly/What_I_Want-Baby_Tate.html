		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna go on a date sometimes
We don’t gotta do it everyday
I don’t really wanna make you mine
But I still wanna call you "Bae"
Truth be told
I don’t really know what I want anymore
I don’t really know what I want

I wanna know you inside out
I wanna know what you be thinking bout
I wanna know what’s in your brain
I wanna know what you can do with that mouth
I wanna know what you can do with that pole
But I don’t wanna go that far
I ain’t never been down that road
No, I ain’t never drove that car
I don’t wanna show my cards
But I wanna know your heart
I don’t wanna play with you
Wanna give you a role, a part
I wanna pair with you like Noah’s Ark
I’ll take the backseat chair for you
No Rosa Parks
I know you’re smart so don’t play stupid
I shot you with a dart, Yung Baby Cupid
Boy let’s do this
Woah boy, let’s go slow (go slow)
I know I just said what I want
But I don’t really know anymore (anymore)
I’m too scared and I don’t wanna
Get my heart broken again
If and when I see you
Imma tell you everything
I’m slipping into love again
It’s such a scary thing

I wanna go on a date sometimes
We don’t gotta do it everyday
I don’t really wanna make you mine
But I still wanna call you "Bae"
Truth be told
I don’t really know what I want anymore
I don’t really know what I want

I don’t want much from you
I’m the one, you the one both of us make two
You can be lil bae you can be big boo
Love everything you say
Cuz you speaking the truth
Like me in the booth only me and you
Cuz we can’t fit three in a coupe
Tell them lames that they late
Need to get in the loop
If I told you go away
I’m only kidding with you
Boy you know I love to play
I’m only kidding with you i’m joking with ya
Smoking with ya get it wet
Soaking with ya lean back, stroking with ya
Need that, hope you brought the poker with ya
If you poking then I’m open
I’m so broken, I can’t help but start closing
Now I don’t mean to send you a mixed message
I know you confused boy I
Know you don’t get it
I don’t get it either I
Don’t wanna lead ya on
One second I need ya the next minute, I don’t
Don’t know what I want
I can’t make up my mind
I know I’m wasting your time
But don’t leave me behind
Baby boy, you know you so fine
So please say you’ll be mine

I wanna go on a date sometimes
We don’t gotta do it everyday
I don’t really wanna make you mine
But I still wanna call you "Bae"
Truth be told
I don’t really know what I want anymore
I don’t really know what I want
I wanna go on a date sometimes
We don’t gotta do it everyday
I don’t really wanna make you mine
But I still wanna call you "Bae"
Truth be told
I don’t really know what I want anymore
I don’t really know what I want
