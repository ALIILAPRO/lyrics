		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm down, feeling blue
I close my eyes, oh just to be with you
I'm a dreamer and you know
You're my woman and I'll never go
God put an angel here on earth
Who gave me more than all I'm worth
You're my angel in the night
In the darkness you're the light

Heaven will know, oh heaven will know
My love will grow baby
Heaven will know
That I need you so
I can't say, goodbye lady

Heaven will know
That I'll never let go
And I'm stay until my heart stand still
No matter what baby
Feel what you want
Heaven sent me an angel
Heaven sent me a star

Don't let me down, take my hand
Now and forever be my friend
Take my lovin' heart tonight
You are a woman 'till the morning light
I dry the tears I've never shown (never shown)
An empty house I call my own
You are my angel in the night
In the darkness you're the light

Heaven will know, oh heaven will know
My love will grow baby
Heaven will know
That I need you so
I can't say, goodbye lady

Heaven will know
That I'll never let go
And I'm stay until my heart stand still
No matter what baby
Feel what you want
Heaven sent me an angel
Heaven sent me a star

And it's more, than a passing phase
And it's more, than a good night's day's
And it's more, than you'll ever know
And you'll never be alone
