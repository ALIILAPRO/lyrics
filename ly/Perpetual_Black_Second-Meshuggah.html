		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped in a ceaseless fever of spite,
an unending fit of resentment and anger
Caught in a moment of unforgiveness
In the snapshot of a hatefilled second

The speedless flickering of uncomprehending eyes
-Dialated in disbelief
Your vacant gaze distorted
Twisted in its accusing glare 

Teeth glimmering in emotional rage
Spit of hate suspended mid-air
Bodies strained in fury
Devoured by jaws of despair

One single image frame I wish to forget
now replayed in succession of millions
The one second I will always regret
-My hell found in its reiteration 

Held within the visualization,
the continuous rerun of my own violence
A fraction of time perpetuated
By my regretful soul animated

Please forgive the evil in me
-The darkness within
Ferocious, inherent demon
Adrenaline gland resident

Threatened subconscious snake
Repressed into striking coil
Surfacing that black second
Ascending with the boil
