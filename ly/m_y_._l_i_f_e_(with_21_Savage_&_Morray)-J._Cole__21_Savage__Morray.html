		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, you came there, God)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh, Lord)
(No matter how, no matter how long it take, yeah)
No matter how long it take, nigga
(Oh, Lord, oh, yeah)
(You better be)

Spiralin' up, just like a rich nigga staircase (staircase)
No fly zone, please stay the fuck out my airspace (out my face)
Niggas say things behind backs that they wouldn't dare say (dare say)
Know it's on sight when I see you, I'm workin' at Squarespace
Yeah, top of the mornin', I know that you thought I was dormant
Woke up early from shots that were swarmin'
A block full of opps, now the cops in an orbit
Guess somebody got popped, now they knockin' on doors
Tryna find an informant but I ain't see Nathan
I'm mindin' my business as God is my witness
No weapon gon' prosper that's formin' against me
Nigga, I'm starvin', immensely
Know when I'm done with these songs, you gon' miss me
Ja Morant, I'm on my Grizzly
You niggas just cubs but no, not the ones in the big leagues
After The Fall Off, I promise I'm comin' and sellin' out Wrigley's
Nigga, I'm just a product of poverty, full of narcotics to profit off quickly
My family tree got a history of users that struggle with demons
Not really the hustler instincts
Therefore, often, my pockets was empty
So while some of my partners was servin' up rocks on the corners, the project assemblies
Me, I was startin' to envy, wanna be on the top where it's plenty
Wanna be in the spot like where every bitch want me like Rihanna droppin' new Fenty
What I see in the sky, the 'Ville is the ceilin', can't reach up too high, evidently
Nah, shit, I can't reach up too high, evidently
Never seen no one drivin' a Bentley
I can't be out here moppin' up Wendy's

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you're sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (come from), so often (so often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life

Say what? The stuff that I've seen got me traumatized
I let the K go when Johnny died
Swangin' that muhfucka' side to side
We don't participate, ain't with that squashin' shit, all we believe in is homicides
I got a good heart, so I send teddy bears every time we make they mamas cry
I pray that my past ain't ahead of me (21)
When I'm in love, I love heavily (on God)
If you betray me, you dead to me (21)
I disrespect you respectfully (straight up)
I got some partners who left this Earth
Maybe the pain made a better me (on God)
Just know that they secrets is kept with me (on God)
I feel like the streets is in debt with me (straight up)
I gave my heart away to all the dawg hoes 'cause that's who accepted me (21)
I blame my pops for that shit 'cause if he didn't fail, he could've corrected me (21)
Give all the props to my mama 'cause no matter what, she always protected me (on God)
I promise you, it ain't no checkin' me (on God)
Jump in the water, get wet with me (straight up, 21, 21)
You want my money or wanna have sex with me?
Can't let the opps or the law get the best of me
I get to answerin', you get to textin' me
I see chicken, you niggas is breast to me
Planted a seed but it ain't a sesame
Can't let you niggas or bitches grow next to me

My life is all I have
My rhymes, my pen, my pad
And I done made it out the struggle, don't judge me
What you're sayin' now won't budge me
'Cause where I come from (come from), so often (so often)
People you grow up with layin' in a coffin
But I done made it through the pain and strife
It's my time now, my world, my life, my life
