		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Enjoy your privileged life
'Cause I'm not gonna hold you through the night
We said our last goodbyes
So let's just try to end it with a smile

And I don't wanna hear that you are sufferin'
You are sufferin', no more
'Cause I held you down when you were sufferin'
You were sufferin'

Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away
Blues away, way, way
I got two red pills to take the blues away

And I'ma fuck the pain away, and I know I'll be okay
They said our love is just a game, I don't care what they say
And I'ma drink the pain away, I'll be back to my old ways
And I got two red pills to take the blues away, oh

(And I don't wanna hear that you are sufferin')
(You are sufferin', no more)
('Cause I held you down when you were sufferin')
No more, no (you were sufferin', no more)

(And I don't wanna hear that you are sufferin') I don't wanna hear you 
(You are sufferin', no more) no more, no more, no
('Cause I held you down when you were sufferin') you know
(You were sufferin') oh, yeah
