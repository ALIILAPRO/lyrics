		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drippin', drip, drip, drippin', drip, drip
Drippin', drip, drip, drip

Fuckin' wit no bitch
Don't act like you know me
You funny wit money Honey
Don't act like a Po bitch

I'm sick of all these fakes (fakes)
I'm sick of all these phonies
Everybody same
They be lame
They be clonin', ya ya, ay

Who you think you frontin' on (Who Dat B)
All you little kiddies run along (brr, brr)
I ain't go anywhere
Uh, ya'll can kiss my derriere, woo

Up in the whip
Up in coupe yah yah (yah yah)
Takin' a flick
Actin' a fool yah yah yah
Everything I got on brand spankin' new
And if I want your man, then I'ma take him, too (I'ma take him, too)

I be sippin' on that goose
Got you feelin' loose (loose)
They all wanna taste my juice (juice)

You ain't fuckin' wit my drip yea
Diamonds blue like a crip yea
I be steady on my grind all day (all day)
Gettin' money every different kinda way (different kinda way) 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'

Look, something dripping from your mouth 
Lemme undo your blouse
Take you straight to the clouds everyday you be flossing
Whole world be watching, gettin' bands with my mans I do this often
I be in office making major moves to cater to my boss type mood
All I ooze is swag
All I do's get the bag
My legacies forever never, just a fad
Talk jewels, cars, clothes, girls 
There's some things you just can't buy with cash
Gangsta's to bankers, they anxious no patience 
They want what I have
Can you blame 'em?
If they join me, I'll prolly chain 'em
Rolling with me shit is life changing
Rolling with me shit is life changing
How many millionaires under me
I own about four or five companies
I'ma be a billionaire prolly (yo)
Holla if you wanna join the Oddyssy (hello)
I'm the fuckin' sheriff of this wild Wild West
Hella connected do a wifi check
Take a shot of Soju and its bye bye stress (bye bye)
Question, am I drippy like swimsuit, yes (yes)

I be sippin' on that goose (goose)
Got you feelin' loose (loose)
They all wanna taste my juice (juice)

You ain't fuckin' wit my drip yea
Diamonds blue like a crip yea
I be steady on my grind all day (all day)
Getting money every different kinda way (different kinda way)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yeah so icy, at the tippy top
Hot like summer, call the plumber
Too much drippy drop (too much)
I see your pockets hurtin' (woo)
Need a band-aid (ah woo)
Get the cash for your crash
That's mandate
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
Drip drip drip drip drip drip drippin'
