		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crazy
All I want is money in my room
Oh baby
I won’t wait to fall in love with you
With you

Your eyes, I see it
It’s obvious about us
Oh Baby
I won’t wait to fall in love with you

No need to stay here
I have to face it somehow
No need to play here
I have to face you somehow, somehow

What if I were to give to you all my devotion
Would it work to take you home
Am I worth the diamonds wrapped around her finger
Does it hurt to see me go
Disappear

Disappear
Tell me kiss me softly does it hurt to see me go
Disappear

Disappear
Disappear

If you feel it
You’ll mean it
You’ll face it
Just be sure you know the deal

Don’t try to find me to start this thing over
Don't be sorry if this isn't real
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear

Disappear

What if I were to give to you all my devotion
Would it work to take you home
Am I worth the diamonds wrapped around her finger
Does it hurt to see me go
Disappear
Disappear

Disappear
