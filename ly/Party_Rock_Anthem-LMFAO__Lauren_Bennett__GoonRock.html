		<p>
		  Party Rock
Yeah
Woo
Let's go

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (woo)
Everybody just have a good time (clap)
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it, baby)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (yeah)
We just wanna see you
Shake that

In the club, party rock
Looking for your girl? She on my jock, huh
Non-stop when we in the spot
Booty moving weight like she on the block (woo)
Where the drank? I gots to know
Tight jeans, tattoo, 'cause I'm rock and roll
Half-black, half-white, domino
Gainin' money, Oprah dough

Yo, I'm running through these hoes like Drano
I got that devilish flow, Rock and Roll, no halo, we party rock
Yeah, that's the crew that I'm reppin'
On the rise to the top, no Led in our Zeppelin (hey)

Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (yeah)
And we gon' make you lose your mind 
Everybody just have a good time (let's go)
Party rock is in the house tonight
Everybody just have a good time (I can feel it, babe)
And we gon' make you lose your mind
We just wanna see you
Shake that

Every day I'm shufflin'
Shufflin', shufflin'

Step up fast and be the first girl to make me throw this cash
We gettin' money don't be mad, now stop, hatin' is bad
One more shot for us, another round
Please fill up my cup, don't mess around
We just wanna see, you shake it now
Now you home with me, you're naked now

Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound
Get up, get down, put your hands up to the sound (woo)
Put your hands up to the sound
Put your hands up to the sound (let's go)
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, put your hands up to the sound, to the sound (woo)
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up

Party rock is in the house tonight (put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good time (put your hands up)
And we gon' make you lose your mind (put your hands up)
Everybody just have a good, good, good time

Whoa (put your hands up)
Whoa (I can feel it, babe)
Whoa (put your hands up)
Whoa (put your hands up)

Shake that
Every day I'm shufflin'

Put your, put your (hands up)
Put your, put your (yeah)
Put your, put your (woo)
(Hands up)
Put your, put your (hands up)
Put your hands up
Your hands up
Put your hands up
