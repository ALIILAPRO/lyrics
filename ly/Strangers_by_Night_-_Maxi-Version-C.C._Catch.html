		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're down and feeling blue
Close your eyes, I'll be with you
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

Making love for him was fun
He never needed anyone
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

Strangers by night
(Strangers by night, by night)
Be strangers tomorrow
'Cause deep in the night
The light is fooling your heart
(Is fooling your heart)

And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Are lovers tomorrow
But lovers by night (lovers by night)
Sometimes be strangers today

Nights won't last forever, girl
Strange are the ways of this world
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

Cinderella, heroes wait
For your hard times it's too late
Oh heartache, here comes heartache

Strangers by night
(Strangers by night, by night)
Be strangers tomorrow
'Cause deep in the night
The light is fooling your heart
(Is fooling your heart)

And lovers tonight inside our hearts
Are lovers tomorrow
But lovers by night (lovers by night)
Sometimes be strangers today

Strangers tonight
(Strangers tonight, tonight)
Be strangers tomorrow
Lady tonight
Tonight be careful with love
(Be careful with love)
Some love is too hot, too hot to stop
A bad fall tomorrow

And lovers by night (lovers by night)
Sometimes be strangers today
And lovers by night (lovers by night)
Sometimes be strangers today
