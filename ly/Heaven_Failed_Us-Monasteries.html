		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The message I received was heaven sent,
I'm not a believer in the man above,
But I think that this was meant for me

Our future held certainty and joy
A plan made between two lovers

The bond was unbreakable 
Unmatched and forever intertwined 
Not even hell below could destroy 

An angel heaven sent 
Was this meant to be 

An angel heaven sent 
I finally feel free

Somewhat a purpose I now have 
Has changed the future in me

As weeks, months go by
Betrayal creeps under our tree

As the roots were torn 
Our flower never more

Never more
Never more 
Our flower never more

An angel heaven sent 
Was this meant to be 

An angel heaven sent 
I finally feel free

An angel heaven sent 
Was this meant to be 

An angel heaven sent 
I finally feel free

Lost soul lovers, lost their other 
Lost soul lovers, lost their other
Lost soul lovers, lost their other

Lost soul lover, heaven failed you
Lost soul lover, I'm so sorry
