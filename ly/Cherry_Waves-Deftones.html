		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A sea of waves we hug the same plank
(Saw your end)
Just as I'd rehearsed over in my brain
(Saw your end)

The waves suck you in and you drown
If like, you should sink down beneath
I'll swim down, would you?
You?

You hang the anchors over my neck
(Saw your end)
I liked it at first but the more you laughed
The crazier I came

The waves suck you in then you drown
If like, you'd just stay down with me
I'll swim down with you
Is that what you want?
You
Is that what you want?

Wave
Wave
Inside

If like, you should stay down beneath
I'll swim down
Would you?
Is that what you want?
Would you?
Is that what you want?
With you?
You
