		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was the water and you were the boat
You said you're drowning, though I kept you afloat
I was the anchor when you needed ground
I wanted to hold you without holding you down

The memory of you won't let me go
It's there on the shore letting me know
The further you get, the closer I am
To finding a place I understand

Where will I feel alive?
Alive
Where will I feel alive?
Alive

We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever

Where will I feel alive?
Alive
Where will I feel alive?
Alive

We are closer than ever
We are closer than ever
