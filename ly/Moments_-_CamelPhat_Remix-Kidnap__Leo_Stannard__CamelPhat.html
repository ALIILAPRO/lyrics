		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Friends are made along the way
In a journey you can't recreate
In these moments I lose focus
I never overcomplicate
I know the way I operate
In these moments

Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now
Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now

I have to move to feel like me
Just understand it's what I need
In these moments I lose focus
So never overcomplicate
Just know the way you operate
In these moments

Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now
Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now

Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now
Oh I feel as though I'm moving this time
So don't try to stop me now
No don't try to stop me now
