		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

Always been loud in a quiet way
I always feel alone in a crowded place
I always wanna stay, wanna go
Wanna stay, wanna go, I don't know
I don't know
I get sad on my birthday
I wanna talk back in the worst way
I always wanna stay, wanna go
Wanna stay, wanna go
I don't know what to say
I wanna throw it all away

I feel like a zombie, I'll die at the party
Yeah, you'll find my body fully covered in confetti
I tried calling somebody to tell them, "Come, get me"
But you'll find my body fully covered in confetti

Singin' la-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
La-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
La-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
La-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)

Find me in the club looking golden
I know everyone, I got no friends
I always wanna stay, wanna go
Wanna stay, wanna go, I don't know
I don't know
And I never know what to say
'Til I'm already walkin' away
Wanna punch you in the face
But I won't, but I might, but I won't
And I don't wanna play
I wanna throw it all away

I feel like a zombie, I'll die at the party
Yeah, you'll find my body fully covered in confetti
I tried calling somebody to tell them, "Come, get me"
But you'll find my body fully covered in confetti

Singin' la-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
La-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
La-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)
La-da-da-da-da (hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm)

Look at the people, they're crazy
Look at the people, they're crazy
Look at the people, they're crazy
Look at the pupils dilatin'
Look at the people, they're crazy (crazy)

I feel like a zombie, I'll die at the party
Yeah, you'll find my body fully covered in confetti
I tried calling somebody to tell them, "Come, get me" (come get me)
But you'll find my body fully covered in confetti

Singin' la-da-da-da-da
