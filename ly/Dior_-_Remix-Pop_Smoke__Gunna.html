Huh, roll another one
Said I'm never lackin', always pistol packing
With them automatics, we gon' send him to Heaven
Wait, wait, wait, wait, ayy, ayy, woo (aw, shit), huh
Oh you feelin' sturdy, huh? (You feelin' sturdy, baby)
(Let me see somethin') Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a nigga
(She let it clap for a nigga)
And she throw it back for a nigga
(Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga)

Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean (uh)
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr

Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean (uh)
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr

When I walk in the spot, thirty on me
Buy out the club, niggas know that I'm paid
Bitch, I'm a thot, get me lit
I can't fuck with these niggas 'cause niggas is gay
All on my page suckin' dick
All in my comments and screamin' my name
While I'm in the club
Throwin' them hundreds and fifties and ones and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time
If you need the glizzy, you could take mine
Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT
Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it
I bet I air it like BNB
Nappy Blue wildin' in my section
And I keep that .38 for the weapon
Remember when I came home from corrections
All the bad bitches in my direction

She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a nigga
(She let it clap for a nigga)
And she throw it back for a nigga
(Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga)

Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean (uh)
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr

New Givenchy, new Givenchy
Hop out a car, it's a Porsche (it's a Porsche)
Rockin Fendi, rockin Fendi
F print on the corduroys (corduroys)
I pull up Aventador ('Ador)
I lift up the doors and draw (doors and draw)
These broke boys shopping in Ross (Ross)
We back in Dior, Dior 
(Dior, Dior, Christian Dior)
I got Valentino denim (denim)
Brand new Mike Amiri denim (denim)
And these Ricky Owen denims (denim)
I drop the bag they gonna hit 'em (hit 'emz)
This baddie wanna pop a skittle (skittle)
I'm tired of niggas telling riddles (riddles)
Till the foreign whipping through the ghetto
Seal 6 vets slime green
Riding 911 Porsche yellow
Plain Patek and an AP
They got 50 pointers and a bezel (bezel)
Speedin whipped like thereto (thereto)
Push these Pradas on the petal (yeah)
Make her swallow down the middle (the middle)
We some giants, nigga's little

She like the way that I dance
She like the way that I move
She like the way that I rock
She like the way that I woo
And she let it clap for a nigga
(She let it clap for a nigga)
And she throw it back for a nigga
(Yeah, she throw it back for a nigga)

Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean (uh)
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr

Mike Amiri, Mike Amiri
Billie Jean, Billie Jean (uh)
Christian Dior, Dior
I'm up in all the stores
When it rains, it pours
She like the way I rrr
