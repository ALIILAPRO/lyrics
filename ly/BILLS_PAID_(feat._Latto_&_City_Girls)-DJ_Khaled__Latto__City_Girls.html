		  We the Best Music
Y'all ready for what's about to happen?
Get yo' money up
(Another one)
Anthems only
Miami, ATL
DJ Khaled

Hol' up, yeah, let me check somethin' (uh)
Please, don't check for me until the check come
He asked me what's my horoscope, I said, "A dollar sign"
Give a fuck 'bout you and yours 'cause I'ma die for mine
Blue hunnids in the pink Birkin (Birkin)
Swipin' with no limit like I'm big pursin' (yeah)
They say I be curvin' niggas, yeah, a bitch curvy (yeah)
I get even when I'm done, he gon' need a Perky (woo)

I want my bills paid (yup), rent paid (yeah)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slayed (yeah)
Keep the pussy juicy like it's marinated (uh)
The way I be killin' shit, I need interrogatin' (woo)

Pull up foreign and I park in the front (skrrt)
Big chillin' when I'm sparkin' a blunt
Bitches knowin' that I'm one of them ones
You can have your nigga back when I'm done (yeah)
I like my niggas in the field like Beckham (yeah)
Made him come up off a check when I met him (when I met him)
He'll fuck around and go broke if I let him
When I meet a nigga, this what I tell him (this what I tell him)

I want my bills paid (yup), rent paid (yeah)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slayed (yeah)
Keep the pussy juicy like it's marinated (uh)
The way I be killin' shit, I need interrogatin' (woo)
I want my bills paid (yeah), rent paid (yup)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slay (uh)
Ain't no such thing as enough, baby (nah)
Boss bitch, got my own but you can upgrade it (woo)

Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
(Let's go)

Look, wet pussy gon' cost you (yeah)
But don't get it confused, I can do without you (on God)
I need them Bottega boots with the clear bottom (yeah)
If I ever dealt with him, then I still got him (ha)
Mugler leggings hugging my butt
Got the gin, five, Glock in the clutch (boop)
If my bills ain't paid, he ain't doin' enough (what?)
Niggas ain't shit, they barely enough, the fuck?

I want my bills paid (yup), rent paid (yeah)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slayed (yeah)
Keep the pussy juicy like it's marinated (uh)
The way I be killin' shit, I need interrogatin' (woo)
I want my bills paid (yeah), rent paid (yup)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slayed (uh)
Ain't no such thing as enough, baby (nah)
Boss bitch, got my own but you can upgrade it (woo)

Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work) (yeah)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work) (yeah)
(City Girls)

Nasty bitch, flip dick like gymnastics
Street bitch, how you think I end up in the palace? (Cash)
Big crib, big diamonds
Pulled up in that drop, bitches ain't lookin' excited (ah)
Black hoochie, dressed down in Louis
Brand new ass, niggas wanna feel my booty
My life is a movie, I'm the star, for certain (yeah)
City Girls the reason y'all hoes know 'bout Birkins (facts)

Twisted through the club like a runway, bitch
Body smokin' like a blunt, I bet your man wanna hit
Sneaky link with a rich nigga, slicker than this
And if you see a hatin' ho, blow a kiss (mwah)
Bop-bop-boppin' through the club, I see it's ballers in here
Miami in the spot, so it's cameras in here
Ugly hoes is hatin', I can tell by the glare
The way you talkin' shit, I can tell them veneers

I want my bills paid (yup), rent paid (yeah)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slayed (yeah)
Keep the pussy juicy like it's marinated (uh)
The way I be killin' shit, I need interrogatin' (woo)
I want my bills paid (yeah), rent paid (yup)
Nails did (uh-huh), hair slayed (uh)
Ain't no such thing as enough, baby (nah)
Boss bitch, got my own but you can upgrade it (woo)

Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work

Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it (work, uh, work)
Make him work for it
