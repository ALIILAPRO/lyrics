		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh

Tell me what you really like
Baby, I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe

You are not the single type
So baby, this the perfect time
I'm just tryna get you high (I'm just tryin', babe)
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So baby, I can make it right
You just gotta let me try (try)
To give you what you want

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe
I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe

(I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe)
(I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe)
(I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe)
(I feel it comin', I feel it comin', babe)

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it could set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me (ooh)

I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I feel it comin', babe)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I know what you feel right now)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I feel it comin', babe)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I know what you say right now, babe)
I feel it comin' (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I feel it comin' babe, oh, babe)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I know what you say right now, babe)
I feel it comin' (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe (I feel it comin', baby)
I feel it comin' (I feel it comin')
I feel it comin', babe

(I feel it comin', babe)
(I feel it comin', babe)
(I feel it comin', babe)
(I feel it comin', babe)
