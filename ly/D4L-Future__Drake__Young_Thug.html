		  (808 my crew)
(Ayy, Southside, where you get all that drip?)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

FBG, YSL, know just what's brackin', yeah (yeah, yeah)
Told my story, gotta clear it by your daddy, yeah (yeah, yeah)
FBG, YSL, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Richard Mille, all this year, nigga, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Louis Vuitton bandana, bro, what hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
D4L, Stunna Man, say what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Bowen Homes, you know, that shiesty shit (what's hannenin'?)
You go outside, you better back it

Oh, my right wrist a Ferrari (skrrt, skrrt)
Foreign breed, American, she call me papi (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Vroom, vroom, Hellcat, give it to the goons (vroom)
On that Earl Manigault, shootin' it out the spoon
Seen a prom queen smoke crack when I was lil'
Million dollars in cash like I sell drugs (sell drugs)
Gave my bitch a hundred racks, vacuum sealed up (vacuum seal, what?)
Vacuum sealed up

FBG, YSL, know just what's brackin', yeah (yeah, yeah)
Told my story, gotta clear it by your daddy, yeah (yeah, yeah)
FBG, OVO, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Richard Mille, all year, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
YSL bandana, man, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
D4L, Stunna Man, man, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Bowen Homes, you know, that shiesty shit (what's hannenin'?)
You go outside, you better back it

Ayy, go to Palm Springs for a daytrip
Freeband, October's Own, it's the same shit
Shawty keep on knockin' back the shots, better pace this
Whoa, whoa, bank knows presidential faces
Whoa, whoa, Bankhead, started seein' spaceships, whoa
We just started fuckin', she impatient
Now she want a butt lift, now she want some LASIK
Just to see the bag clearer, that way she can chase it
Ayy, ayy
I remember grade six, I was up in Payless tryna get some Asics
Now I'm Nike'd down in a motherfuckin' snake pit
Now I'm type of nigga give it out and I don't take shit

I been in the cut for thirteen thousand months
(Ayy, Southside, where you get all that drip?)
All that brr, you gon' think we from Saudi Arabia
Money comin', brr (yeah)
Ayy, my trap comin' up the street, brr (let's go)
I ran a check up on my feet, brr (run it up)
Bentley talk, Bentley talk, brr (Bentley)
Go ask your mama, I'm a boss, brr (boss)
I got oil, I'm your daddy, brr (daddy)
I bought her a 'Rari (swerve), brr (skrrt, 'Rari, yeah)
I eat calamari, brr (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'ma let her park me

FBG, YSL, know just what's brackin', yeah (yeah, yeah)
Told my story, gotta clear it by your daddy, yeah (yeah, yeah)
FBG, YSL, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Richard Mille, all this year, nigga, what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Louis Vuitton bandana, bro, what hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
D4L, Stunna Man, say what's hannenin'? (What's hannenin'?)
Bowen Homes, you know, that shiesty shit (what's hannenin'?)
You go outside, you better back it
