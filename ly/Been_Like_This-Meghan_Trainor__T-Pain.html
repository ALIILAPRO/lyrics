		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-wee, she got that booty
What type of boom-boom, that bass that I like
I said, "Who, me?" I keep it juicy
So better hold on, hold on for dear life

Oh, 'cause she's cute and she's classy
Thick, bold and sassy
She knows what she do when she moves (when she moves)
I know it's hard to imagine
But, why you keep asking
Like all this came out of the blue?

But I been like this, I been like this
Run your mouth, but I'm on your lips
Say nothin' new, still that bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
I been like this, I been like this
Take your shots while I blow a kiss
Say nothin' new, still that bitch
'Cause I been like, been like- (boom-boom)

Baby, I want you to (ooh)
Shake a little (ooh)
Make it jiggle (ooh)
Put that thing in the middle for Meghan and Pizzle (ooh)
'Cause you doin' it just the way I like
Now you can't fool me
I know exactly what you wanna do to me
And baby, you just gonna make me act up on this flight

We gon' ride first class to Heaven
Your hands all over this legend
Don't stress, baby, that's just the way that I do
Trippin' over these Grammy's
But who to needs a stand when
That reservation got levitation for two?
We goin' up

'Cause I been like this (this), I been like this (this)
Talk that smack, but I'm on your lips
I got money to the ceiling 'cause I'm filthy rich
'Cause I been like this, been like this
Said, I been like this (this), I been like this (this)
Talk that smack (woo), but I'm on your lips
It ain't nothin' new, just me and my bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this

I'm a popstar, I'm a wifey
Put a next by my name if you don't like me (oh)
(Not a thing you do excites me)
(I'ma have to get a little bit spicy)
Oh, you do the most (oh)
Oh, darling, you must be obsessed for me
You like me, like me, like me (oh)

But I been like this, been like this
Talk that smack, but I'm on your lips
But ain't nothin' new, still that bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
I said I been like this, I been like this
Talk that smack, but I'm on your lips
It ain't nothin' new, just me and my bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this

Ooh-ooh (boom-boom)
It ain't nothin' new, just me and my bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
