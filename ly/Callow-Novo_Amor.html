		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold your tongue we never swayed,
pour the faults all away

Cold in lungs and in face
A golden heart, of what became?

It was an awful lot for our young days
Is it love you want 'cus it's love you've made

The cheer within will find a home,
the fear you bring burns below

I can taste the wait and watch you waste away
But I can't face the days, you were born astray

It was an awful lot for our young days
and what an ache i've made for a hollow embrace,
with the blood you flaunt why would you stay

I'm stackin' up on what i'll take,
but the ballot doesn't hold your name
You're wrapping up when winter fades,
I'm holding on the callow ways.

It was an awful lot for our young days.
