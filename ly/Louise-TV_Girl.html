		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Louise, she just wasn't thinking
When she climbed into his bed
She only wanted to lie beside him
To hell with his best friend
She woke him up and she whispered
But the answer wasn't good:
"Whatever made you think I
Would ever love you even if I could?"

Louise (Louise)
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise (Louise) i'll love you 'til I'm dead
Louise (Louise)
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France

She came from across the country
Just to stare into her phone
She came to the same apartment
She only wanted to be left alone
And she could catch anybody's attention
But it never won her friends
Love could kick you out on the streets
But it never paid your rent

Louise (Louise)
You can't be anybody's friend
Louise (Louise) i'll love you til I'm dead
Louise (Louise)
Not even if she likes the way you dance
Louise never heard about puppy love
'Cause they don't know that term in France
