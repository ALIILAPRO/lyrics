		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm not my best but I feel it coming closer now (closer now)
Everything I say in jest
Only knowing I'm yet to rest
Cry it out, cry it out, let it run, let it run
As I'm screaming out, face down the barrel of a gun

All that I've forgotten
Lies within
Now that it's in blossom
Won't disappear
I promise it's not stopping
Seeing clear
Now that it's in blossom
I'm facing fear

Our minds they keep us frozen
Iced into a world that we hold like a burden
Bound and tied
Intolerant, in our own lie
How can I reach for stars
When they are falling apart

All that I've forgotten
Lies within
Now that it's in blossom
Won't disappear
I promise it's not stopping
Seeing clear
Now that it's in blossom
I'm facing fear

Endless life lessons
Fed up of these false confessions

I'm here to confess
I've been hateful I've been spiteful
And I'm trying my best
As I'm learning to grow

All that I've forgotten
Lies within
Now that it's in blossom
Won't disappear
Won't disappear
