		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't gotta run from it
It's not a shame that you want it
Just to keep your head right 
We can keep it air tight
No one gotta know why you coming
We can do the up and down or the underground
You ain't gotta hear a thing about the money
We're just here to run around
We could even lounge
If you wanna bounce, hit the ground runnin'

Thinking of you
Brings me peace
I'm alright
Laying with you
Brings release
For the night
For the night

Don't got no time to fool around, I know you're mine
Know all your friends they looking out but can't relate
They always end up saying some shit that I don't like
I'll be your home tonight

Thinking of you
Brings me peace
I'm alright
Laying with you
Brings release
For the night
For the night

Don't got no time to fool around, I know you're mine
Know all your friends they looking out but can't relate
They always end up saying some shit that I don't like
I'll be your home tonight

Thinking of you
Brings me peace
I'm alright
Laying with you
Brings release
For the night
For the night
