		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Hey brah, how we doin' man?"
"Alright"
"It's been a while man, life's so rad
This band's my favorite, man, don't ya love 'em?"
"Yeah"
"Aw man, you want a beer?"
"Alright"
"Aw man, hell, brah, this is the best, man
I'm so glad we're all back together and stuff
This is great, man"
"Yeah"
"Hey, do you know about the party after the show?"
"Yeah"
"Ah man, it's gonna be the best, I'm so stoked
Take it easy, brah"

I'm me
Me be
Goddamn
I am
I can
Sing and
Hear me
Know me

If you want to destroy my sweater
Hold this thread as I walk away

"Hey, what's up?"
"Not much"
"Um, did you hear about the party?"
"Yeah"
"I think I'm gonna go, but, um
My friends don't really wanna go
Could I get a ride?"

Oh no
It go
It gone
Bye-bye
Who I
I think
I sink
And I die

If you want to destroy my sweater (whoa, oh, oh)
Hold this thread as I walk away (as I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor, lying on the floor
I've come undone

If you want to destroy my sweater (whoa, oh, oh)
Hold this thread as I walk away (as I walk away)
Watch me unravel, I'll soon be naked
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone

I don't want to destroy your tank top (if you want to destroy my sweater)
Let's be friends and just walk away (hold this thread as I walk away)
It's good to see you (watch me unravel)
lying there in your Superman skivvies (I'll soon be naked)
Lying on the floor (lying on the floor)
I've come undone
