		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (What you feeling like?)
I feel like I'm the highest in the room
I feel like I could fucking kiss the moon
See shawty over there, bitch looking at me, she kinda cute
See a nigga over there, he's steamin' on up like ramen soup

I've been tripping, had a blue dream
Breathe into me, you know
Inhale, exhale, I'm so dizzy
They can't save me, I'm gone
Woah, oh, they don't go as hard as I do, oh
I brought some to the party for you, oh
I'll mix it up and serve it for you
Party favors for you
Party favors for you

Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, now baby I got that special juice for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you

Clouds of smoke are rising in the air
I feel their eyes when everybody stare
See a hater over there, they scheming on me 'cause I'm the truth
I'm with my homies over here and we ain't got no love for you

I've been tripping, had a blue dream
Breathe into me, you know
Inhale, exhale, I'm so dizzy
They can't save me, I'm gone
Woah, oh, they don't go as hard as I do, oh
I brought some to the party for you, oh
I'll mix it up and serve it for you
Party favors for you
Party favors for you

Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, now baby I got that special juice for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you

It's something fishy going on and I smell it
You leave that dough around that girl and she'll deal it
Papi stay outside the first time, I just forget it
I know if she get pulled over, boy she'll tell it
Yeah nigga I know
Hit her with the sham, but no mop and glow
Put that bitch on the E-way and it ain't no stop and go
I took Hannah Montana before the show
I got 300 bands on me, no Calico
Rolling out that bounty check your visas
Pull up in that 'Rari watch your G's house
Hard smile for the one's that didn't believe us
Hard dick for the ones that didn't wanna be with us
Lots of bullets for them boys that mislead us
Yeah, nigga bustin', way too hot to touch him
But I'm elephant tusking
Real gangsta, bitch, I'm on my Russian

Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
Oh, now baby I got that special juice for you
Oh, I got some party favors for you
