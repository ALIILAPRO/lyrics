		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they're more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head

In my own way, this feel like living
Some alternate reality
And I was drowning, but now I'm swimming
Through stressful waters to relief
Yeah, all the things I'd do
To spend a little time in hell
And what I won't tell you
I'll prolly never even tell myself
And don't you know that sunshine don't feel right
When you inside all day
I wish it was nice out, but it look like rain
Grey skies and I'm drifting, not living forever
They told me it only gets better

My regrets look just like texts I shouldn't send
And I got neighbors, they more like strangers
We could be friends
I just need a way out of my head
I'll do anything for a way out
Of my head
