		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was blindsided
Couldn't see it coming
Too young to be treated like that
You were on something
Cut me down to nothing
And your knife's still stuck in my back

Keep saying one day I'll regret it
But I don't
Probably thinking one day, I'll forget it
But I won't

Oh, I gave you everything that I couldn't afford to lose
Now, I pull myself together
And you come out of the blue
Taking all the better parts of me is all you ever do
Now, the second I find something good
I know that
You're gonna want that too
Hmm-hmm
You're gonna want that too
Hmm-hmm

Heard you're throwing shots
Watch them ricochet
I got time for everything but your shit today
I'm not waiting for your call, but I know you will
That's the only hand left that you got to play

Keep saying one day I'll regret it
But I don't
Probably thinking one day, I'll forget it
But I promise you now I won't

Oh, I gave you everything that I couldn't afford to lose
Now, I pull myself together
And you come out of the blue
Taking all the better parts of me is all you ever do
Now, the second I found something good
I know that
You're gonna want that, too
Hmm-hmm
You're gonna want that, too
Hmm-hmm

No, no, no, no
Take my innocence for weakness
Take my money
I don't need it
'Cause that's all you ever wanted
Didn't you?
Take my youth and fuck me over
Made me realize now I'm older
Never wanna be anything like you

Oh, I gave you everything that I couldn't afford to lose
And I pull myself together
You come out of the blue
Taking all the better parts of me is all you ever do
Now, the second I found something good
I know that
You're gonna want that too
Oh-oh, you're gonna want that too
