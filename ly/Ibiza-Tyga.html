		<p>
		  (Mustard on the beat, hoe)

Popped a Molly, I'm flexin', woo, woo
Come and meet me, I'm ready, woo, woo
Ay, I just walked off the jetty (jetty)
Ay, VVS on baguetti (necklace, ice)
I, I got clout and I leverage (leverage)
Ay, my bitch got face of advantage
Ay, ass shaped like a planet
Ay, Turks and Caico, she tannin' (ay, ay)

I didn't plan this, everything organic
I just paid a quarter for a bag, they don't panic
Fly across Atlantic and I'm eatin' fancy
Sittin' at home, know you niggas can't stand me
I'm on FaceTime and your bitch gettin' nasty
Tell the driver slow down, fuck her in the backseat
She say, "Where you goin'?" And I tell her, "Don't ask me" (no)
'Cause I fall in love every time a bitch pass me

I-i'm super turnt, I can't pick up (pick up)
Popped a Molly, let's link up (link up)
Ay, we throw party like Ibiza ('Biza)
Ay, if that's your bitch, you can keep her
She wanna be mine, she tell me, "Go deeper" (deeper)
Got my respect like Aretha ('Retha)
Yeah, I had too much Tequila (Tequila)
Ay, bad bitches, let's link up (link up)

Ibiza (Ibiza)
We throw parties like Ibiza (Ibiza)
Ibiza (Ibiza)
Bad bitches, let's link up (link up)

Yeah, I get standin' ovations, woo, woo
I got all these bitches shakin', woo, woo
Ay, we gon' smoke like Jamaican (ay)
If she sittin' on my lap, don't break it (ay)
And that ring on your finger, that's a nice size (nice size)
If she wanna be loyal, tel her that's fine (that's fine)
She got me workin' hard for it, doin' overtime (overtime)
Only here for one night, don't got no time (woo)

And you only twenty-one, you a baby (baby)
Ay, she gon' do a split, go crazy (crazy)
I'ma surfboard in the pussy, go jetski (jetski)
Ay Mrs. Officer, she wanna arrest me
Take me and bless me
'Pease and undress me
Gotta clean it up 'cause you know, she get messy (eugh)
Why your friend starin' at me? Like she wanna sex me
Is you down for the threezy? Baby let's see

I'm super turnt, I can't pick up (pick up)
Popped a Molly, let's link up (link up)
Ay, we throw party like Ibiza ('Biza)
Ay, if that's your bitch, you can keep her
She wanna be mine, she tell me, "Go deeper" (deeper)
Got my respect like Aretha ('Retha)
Yeah, I had too much Tequila (Tequila)
Ay, bad bitches, let's link up (link up)

Ibiza (Ibiza)
We throw parties like Ibiza (Ibiza)
Ibiza (Ibiza)
Bad bitches, let's link up (link up)
