		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Boy with a broken soul
Heart with a gaping hole
Dark twisted fantasy turned to reality
Kissing death and losing my breath
Midnight hours cobble street passages
Forgotten savages, forgotten savages

Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Let her find a way to a better place
Broken dreams and silent screams
Empty churches with soulless curses
We found a way to escape the day

Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Lost in the pages of self made cages
Life slips away and the ghosts come to play
These are hard times
These are hard times for dreamers
And love lost believers

Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Let her find a way to a better place
Broken dreams and silent screams
Empty churches with soulless curses
We found a way to escape the day

Candy bar creep show
My highs hit a new low
Marinate in misery
Like a girl of only seventeen
Man made madness
And the romance of sadness
Beautiful dance that happened by chance
Happened by chance, happened by chance

Dig up her bones but leave the soul alone
Let her let her let her let her find her way back home
Broken dreams and silent screams
Empty churches with soulless curses
We found we found we found a way to escape the day
