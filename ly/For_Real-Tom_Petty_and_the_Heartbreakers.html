		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh brother, look what we've become
Oh brother, could we be so dumb?
They set us up like dominoes
I didn't do it for no magazine
Didn't do it for no video
Never did it for no CEO
But I did it for real

Would've done it for free
I did it for me
'Cause it was all that rang true
I did it for real
And I did it for you

Might've done it for my sanity
Maybe done it for my vanity
Could be I did it for my picky goal
But I did it for real

Would've done it for free
Yeah, I did it for me
'Cause it was all that rang true
I did it for real
And I did it for you, too

Oh brother, look what we've become
Oh brother, I've been overrun
Only did it for the way it made me feel
Yeah I did it for real
Would've done it for free
Yeah I did it for me
'Cause it was all that rang true
I did it for real
And I did it for you
