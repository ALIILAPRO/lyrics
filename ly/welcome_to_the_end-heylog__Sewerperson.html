		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Killing all the memories
Can't get them out my head
Do you think you'll remember me? What
A great way to end
Now she's giving me goosebumps
Up and down my skin i don't wanna hurt you
But we were getting tense
I despise you 'cause I really tried my best
But was there something wrong
With anything I did? This fire burns
It's burning out my chest
My hairs developing curls
She run it with her nails

I left her a note but I
Kept it secret in my hеad
Guess you'll never know what I had
Wrotе or what I said let me clear the air
I don't consider you a friend
Oh, how we were toxic, it was to our benefit
If you truly love her
Go and say it to her face but he never will
He only spoke it through the pain
His scars present a symbol she
Will carry with attain
And she looks at him with disgust
And hatred and with vain
She let him slip by but who's
The one that holds the blame
She don't care 'cause she got guys who
Provide all the needs she craves
'Cause he could never satisfy her so
He solved it on a blade
She acted like she cared
But it was nothing but a fake

I don't know how to act right I guess
And you should prolly leave
Don't want a witness
Calling down to the two friends I have
But they ain't never here
I crave your love bad
So I don't know how to act right I guess
And you should prolly leave
Don't want a witness
Calling down to the two friends I have
But they ain't never here
I crave your love bad
So I don't know how to act right I guess
And she's mindless talking back with her ex
But he never loved her, only loved the sex
I give up, I'm so done with this

Through the wind I smell the blood
It tastes to me like broken heart
I know I feel my body cold
And hungry reaching out for more
Peaceful, I could sleep peaceful finally
Breaks in the trees in my bed
Pines needle my heart
I'm still deep in the rows
All despite the fresh start
And it's killing me
I'm just not myself for the time being
Promise you baby, I’ve changed I swear
Bodies in the garden behind my stairs
I just woke up with 'em laying right there
Crush, crush, crush all these bugs in my hair
Guess I came back from the dead for a moment
I cannot speak with my mouth sewn shut
Broke open welcome to the end you’ve chosen

Kill all the memories can’t get
Them out my head
Do you think you’ll remember me? What
A great way to end
Even if I was what they said
Would you still love me then?
