		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I’m away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that's why I

Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don’t play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that's why I
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that's why I
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don’t play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I’m away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that’s why I
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that’s why I
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that's why I
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray that's why I
