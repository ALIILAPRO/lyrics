		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah, mm, mm
From Bamenda, it's Libianca, oh
(Ayo, Mage, made a bang)

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now did you notice me?
Nobody will know the paranoia, oh
'Cause I put a smile on my face
A facade you can never face (ooh)
And if you don't know me well, well, oh
You won't see how buried I am inside my grave
Inside my grave

'Cause you see people, people, people
People don't really know you
They don't really know you
'Cause you see people, people, people
They don't really know you
They don't really know

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now did you notice me?
Oh, Holy Father
Oh, Holy Father, I dey try for hold my head
I say make you no leave me diko
Oh, Holy Father, yeah
Oh, make you try for understand
Yahoo girl no dey for here

'Cause you see people, people, people
People don't really know you (they don't really know)
They don't really know you (oh)
'Cause you see people, people, people
They don't really know you
They don't really know

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now did you notice me?
I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
Now did you look for me?
I walked in the room, eyes are red
And I don't smoke banga
Did you check on me? (Did you check on me?)
Now did you notice me?

I've been drinking more alcohol for the past five days
Did you check on me?
