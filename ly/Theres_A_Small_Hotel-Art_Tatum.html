		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd like to get away, Junior
Somewhere alone with you
It could be oh, so gay, Junior
You need a laugh
Or two

A certain place I know, Frankie
Where funny people can have fun
That's where the two will go,
Darling

Before you can count up
One, two, three. 
For there's a small hotel
With a wishing well

I wish that we were there together
There's a bridal suite
One room bright and neat
Complete for us to
Share together

Looking through the window
You can see a distant steeple
Not a sign of people who
Wants people?
When the steeple bell says,
"Good night, sleep well,"
We'll thank the small hotel
Together

We'll creep into our little shell
And we will thank the small hotel together
