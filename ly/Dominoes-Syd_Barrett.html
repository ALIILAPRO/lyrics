		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's an idea someday
In my tears, my dreams
Don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm
You and I, you and I and dominoes
The day goes by

You and I in place
Wasting time on dominoes
A day so dark, so warm
Life that comes of no harm
You and I and dominoes
Time goes by

Fireworks and heat someday
Hold a shell, a stick or play
Overheard a lark today, losing when my mind's astray
Don't you want to know with your pretty hair?
Stretch out your hand
Glad feel in an echo for your way

It's an idea someday
In my tears, my dreams
Don't you want to see her proof?
Life that comes of no harm
You and I and dominoes
The day goes by
