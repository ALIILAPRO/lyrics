		  Haha, Dorrough I got somethin' on my mind, homie
Get big
Get big
Get big

Now, it's Dorrough music
You ain't (you ain't)
Gotta (gotta)
Nuff (nuff)
Money (money)
Money (money)
Ha, Dorrough let's go and do this thing man. You ready?

Wh-wh-what you got a dollar in yo' pocket,
A 20 in yo' wallet,
See me stackin' money
Matta fact I let you watch it
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
You ain't (you ain't)
Gotta (gotta)
Nuff (nuff)
Money (money)
Money (money)
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big

Say, hu-hu-hundreds, fifties, bitch I don't exaggerate,
This a game for ballers only ballers can participate,
All these niggas frontin' throwin' money like they paper long,
European diamonds throwin' money now they paper gone,
Idiot, wh-wh-what are you,
Coach we need a W,
And this nigga game suck,
I think it's time to substitute,
Them ain't really diamonds in your ear somebody hustled you,
Takin' all your revenue,
Boy you don't know what to do,
Ha say you wit a double hustle yo' fees,
Oh broke ass rass,
Ain't, gotta nuff cheese,
And you out here lookin' phony tryna stunt like me,
Nigga please, oh broke ass nigga.

What you got a dollar in yo' pocket,
A twenty in yo' wallet,
See me stackin' money
Matta fact I let you watch it
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
You ain't (you ain't)
Gotta (gotta)
Nuff (nuff)
Money (money)
Money (money)
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big

See money I can't talk about,
Bitch I'm 'bout to run the South,
Walk away yo' city in my Dallas Texas fitted cap
I'll be gettin' money from you bitches what you talkin' 'bout,
Spendin' all yo money on these bitches what is that about,
Ugly, st-stupid ass,
I'll be makin' stupid cash,
Just pay real attention like them niggas in a stupid class,
Watch me youngsters, motherfuckin monster,
Pl-playin' with this paper like I'm playin' in a dumpster,
Yo' baby mama payin' all yo' bills, you'z a busta,
Even though she workin' 9 to 5 she still a hustla,
Yeah that means she's runnin' thangs,
While you out here lookin' lame,
Damn, what a shame, oh broke ass nigga.

What you got a dollar in yo' pocket,
A twenty in yo' wallet,
See me stackin' money
Matta fact I let you watch it
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
You ain't (you ain't)
Gotta (gotta)
Nuff (nuff)
Money (money)
Money (money)
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big

Lil mama know I'm in her city,
And I'm out here lookin' pretty,
Gettin' money 'till it's silly,
I'm just out her on my diddy,
What she say (ha-ha, she like),
Yeah he did that,
Oh girl, yeah I like the way he did that,
Girl you know I'm greedy,
Touchy touchy feely feely,
First I stem her like the kitty,
Then I hit her with this willy,
What she say (yeah buddy, she like)
Yeah he did that,
Oh girl, yeah I like the way he did that
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get big
Get me
Now, it's Dorrough, music (get big)
