		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Carolina, do you have it all? The things you want and more. Like insomnia, do you feel it in your bones? Are you trying to let it go?

It's not the secrets that you keep. This water doesn't run too deep. In the morning you'll finally sleep. When you learn to let it be. 

I should have told you, I won't be back tonight. I'll be out there chasing light. Paranoia, is it getting in your way? Plaguing you for days. 

It's not the secrets that you keep. The evening sun brings no heat. In the morning you'll finally sleep. When you learn to let it be. 

It's not the secrets that you keep. This water doesn't run too deep. In the morning you'll finally sleep. 

It's not the secrets that you keep. The evening sun brings no heat. In the morning you'll finally sleep. When you learn to let it be.
