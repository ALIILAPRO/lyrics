		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We on that gang shit, splat his brain shit
Hit his main bitch, gang shit
Slidin' with the blicky, ridin' dangerous
Apeshit, every day shit, I'm tryna equate shit
Straight bitch, how you in the pen without no makeshift?
Straight bitch, niggas turn pussy on that Mace shit
Fake bitch, I don't wanna fuck her, she got facelift
Lane switch, I ain't raw runnin' on that late shift
Claim to be a killer but double back with the same clique, whoa

How you sellin' coochie but ain't made shit, huh?
Thirty days are better at the Days Inn, yeah
Fuck taggin' on your wall, nigga, we sprayin' shit
Put all the opps on a cot, we be layin' shit
And we poppin' up any sucker we catch poppin' out
And her partner booty is bigger so I'ma swap 'em out
I don't sip with peasants, these niggas' sodas be watered down
We ain't finna argue on Insta, that shit is not allowed
YSL pants on, blicky on me poppin' out
We chase niggas down with Glock-9s for chasin' clout
Bitch, we some thugs, we sellin' drugs, fuck is a drought?
How he a stepper when we stomped him out? (Ooh)

We on that gang shit, splat his brain shit
Hit his main bitch, gang shit
Slidin' with the blicky, ridin' dangerous
Apeshit, every day shit, I'm tryna equate shit
Straight bitch, how you in the pen without no makeshift?
Straight bitch, niggas turn pussy on that Mace shit
Fake bitch, I don't wanna fuck her, she got facelift
Lane switch, I ain't raw runnin' on that late shift
Claim to be a killer but double back with the same clique

They ain't really killers, these niggas bitches (bitch-ass niggas)
When you pull up to my hood, you see glizzies with a bunch of switches (brra)
AR-15s holdin' hundreds and a lot of fifties
How I'm movin' dolo in your city? Killers rockin' with me (they rockin' with me)
Ayy, bullet-proof GLE, bunch of shottas with me (shottas with me)
Call a nigga "NLE," keep that chopper with me (let's go)
Bitch I bless 'em, I ain't sneeze, I just cock and squeeze (cock it back)
And his bitch with YG and a lot of Ps (gang)
Hell gang, Boppa died, we threw a lot of Bs (gang)
I ain't speakin' rap beef, only Glockenese (boom)
Gotta high-five opps 'cause they all dead (all dead)
Shoot a nigga arm, leg, leg, arm, head

We on that gang shit, splat his brain shit
Hit his main bitch, gang shit
Slidin' with the blicky, ridin' dangerous
Apeshit, every day shit, I'm tryna equate shit
Straight bitch, how you in the pen without no makeshift?
Straight bitch, niggas turn pussy on that Mace shit
Fake bitch, I don't wanna fuck her, she got facelift
Lane switch, I ain't raw runnin' on that late shift
Claim to be a killer but double back with the same clique
