		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just had a dream that you were far away
And that someone else was in your arms today
Though I know its just a dream
Still my fear is so extreme
â€˜Coz I know that dreams could sometimes be so true
And I'll be blue

Then I told myself
I'll always stay the same
Even if you hurt me, I will take the blame
You are all I'm livin' for
I would love you even more
I would keep the pain inside my door

~CHORUS~

It's enough for me that I have come to love you, I see
Because the heart I have could only want you
I just want you to remember
even if it takes forever
I would wait until the world is through
When all that's left is only me and you

Yes, I told myself I'd always stay the same
Even if you hurt me
I would take the pain
You are all I'm livin' for
I would love you even more
I would keep the pain inside my door

~CHORUS~

I'll wait for you
you know its true
Until again i'll be with you
When all that's left
Is only me and you
