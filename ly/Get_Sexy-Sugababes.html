		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah
Whoo

When I'm walkin' down the street they say
Hey, sexy (hey, sexy)
When I'm dancin' in the club they say
Hey, sexy (hey, sexy)
When I'm driving in my car
Or I'm standing at the bar
It don't matter where I are
They say hey sexy (hey, sexy)

Silly boys
They lovin' me so much
Silly boys
You can look but you can't touch
Silly boys
I ain't got no time to talk
Silly boys
Just shut up and watch me walk

'Cause I'm too sexy in this club
Too sexy in this club
So sexy it hurts
If you feel sexy in this club
Then go 'head toast it up
Take it down, let's get sexy
Right now (now, now, now)

Get sexy right now (now, now, now)
G-g-g-g-get sexy right now (now, now, now)
G-g-g-g-get sexy right now (now, now, now)
N-n-n-n-now

When I'm shopping with my girls they say
Hey, sexy (hey, sexy)
In a two piece at the beach they say
Hey, sexy (hey, sexy)
When they put me on their arms
So they maximize their charm
'Cause I'm shining like a star
Yeah, I'm so sexy (hey, sexy)

Silly boys
They lovin' me so much
Silly boys
You can look but you can't touch
Silly boys
I ain't got no time to talk
Silly boys
Just shut up and watch me walk

'Cause I'm too sexy in this club
Too sexy in this club
So sexy it hurts
If you feel sexy in this club
Then go 'head toast it up
Take it down, let's get sexy
Right now (now, now, now)

Get sexy right now (now, now, now)
G-g-g-g-get sexy right now (now, now, now)
G-g-g-g-get sexy right now (now, now, now)
N-n-n-n-now

If I had a dime (dime)
For every single time (time)
These boys stop and stare (stare)
I'd be a billionaire

Yeah if I had a dime (dime)
For every single time (time)
These boys stop and stare (stare)
I'd be a billionaire

'Cause I'm too sexy in this club
Too sexy in this club
So sexy it hurts
If you feel sexy in this club
Then go 'head toast it up
Take it down, let's get sexy
Right now (now, now, now)

Get sexy right now (now, now, now)
G-g-g-g-get sexy right now (now, now, now)
G-g-g-g-get sexy right now (now, now, now)
N-n-n-n-now
