		<p>
		  Wheezy outta here

Worth a couple hundred 'mill, no thousand
This bitch wanna fuck me, but I charge by the hour
My neck and my wrist in the shower
Like how the fuck you growing up and baby say you childish?
I just bought my young bitch a watch and now she wilding
Styling, profiling, you bitches can't devour
And I'm Creflo Dollar smiling
We somewhere on a island, vibing
Balls smell like powder (let's go)
Fuck it, take it to trial (yeah, yeah)

Take this shit to motherfucking trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfucking trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfucking trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfucking trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)

Slime green AP look like herpes on my wrist, uh
Hold on, cook, woo, I'm so Chef Boyardee with the dish
I don't know you, bitch, don't try to tell me tie my kicks
Tie my chips, ain't talkin' no dip

Tell my baby mama tripping, she don't get it
I'm on a mission to get these millions
I'm on the grind, and I'ma get it
No cap, nigga, no kizzy
Slime 'em out, then they 'gon tell 'em I ain't listen
Once he call, he 'gon say that I'm trippin
Ain't slime, that's just how I feel (nope)
You do not meet the criteria (nope)
I rep my life, for real (yeah)
That's your first time, for real (yeah)
For slimes, you know I kill (yeah, yeah)
Baby, goodnight, my dear
Trial, I done beat it twice, state, I'm undefeated like
Feds came and snatched me, I don't know, no point in asking
I was on Bleveland, stuck like a magnet
Bitch ass nigga, I shoot at your mammy
Need to stand down if you can't stand me
I don't turn down, I up my stamina
Take it to trial, get a appeal
Take it to trial, yeah, you 'gon wack em
No back and forth, we don't tongue wrestle
Pay for that casket, that's just if we whack 'em

Yeah, yeah
My young niggas pulling up, Bentleys, Aston Martins, 'Raris and Teslas
Strapped with a FN, choppas, carbons, know some steppers
Got ice, not in no fridge, not in the safe, we like treasure
We fuck, have a lot of sex and her head feel like pleasure
Shawty super slurpy, suck that birky out that dick (oh wow), ah
Maybach came with curtains and I still went got it tint (on God)
YSL slimey and shady, they ain't wavy like my clique (wavy)
High-end alterations, did that European stitch
Fuck niggas get hit, I got me a opp list
I'm quick to switch topics, ah, no way I can snitch (no way)
Watch me whack that bitch, pop 'em like a 'cist
Glock with the assist

Take this shit to motherfucking trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfucking trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfucking trial (yeah, yeah)
Take this shit to motherfucking trial, yeah (yeah, yeah)
