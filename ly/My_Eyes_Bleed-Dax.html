		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My eyes bleed i don't cry no more
The pain that spills is tainted
Filled with my sorrows and when I speak
My words right my wrongs
I pray one day the pain
Will stay inside these songs

Know when we started, know when we met
That was the best day I had
Every day since back then
I can't get you off my head
Every thought, every step
You were the one that I had
You had a spot in my bed
Now you're a pain on my chest
Know that I don't even wanna tell this story
This book doesn't end in glory
That day at the back of the party
Caught you and you screamed you're sorry
I walked outside and cried and noticed
That I started to bleed the rush of pain
Betrayal then buckled me right to my knees
I can't help myself
I had you, didn't want no one else
How'd you think it felt?
Why don't these songs help?

My eyes bleed
I don't cry no more (I don't cry no more)
The pain that spills is tainted
Filled with my sorrows (My sorrows)
And when I speak (When I speak)
My words right my wrongs (Wrongs, wrongs)
I pray one day the pain
Will stay inside these songs
(Inside these songs)

And if it don't
The memories we had will haunt
And won't let me go
And I'll be forced to face the rain one day
Then realize that I'm all on my own
My heart is broke
But you knew that would happen
When you gave him yours
I hope you know this hurts and it
Shakes me right to my core
Some things you cannot take back
I'm not perfect, but I tried
So don't you even say that
And every time I press replay in my mind
I feel blood rushin' straight to my eyes

My eyes bleed
I don't cry no more (I don't cry no more)
The pain that spills is tainted
Filled with my sorrows (My sorrows)
And when I speak (When I speak)
My words right my wrongs (Wrongs, wrongs)
I pray one day the pain
Will stay inside these songs
(Inside these songs)
