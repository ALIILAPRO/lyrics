		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

I can see it in your eyes
You don't love me like, like you say you do
Got a feelin' that we're fading
Lookin' for a way we could make it through

If it isn't you, it's nothing
You know that nobody feels like you
Now I'm begging, keep pretending
Tell me that I'm everything to you

And string me along
One more time, one more time, one more
Leading me on
It's so wrong that it's right when you lie
Lie to me, tonight
Tell me that you love me
Even though it's all a lie, oh
Lie, pretty little lie
You don't need to mean it
I'll believe it when you lie, so lie

Li-li-lie
Li-li-lie
So lie, so lie
Li-li-lie
Li-li-lie
So lie, so lie, mm

Can you give me anything
Any little thing, make me think you'll stay
You know we could steal the magic
Fantasizing that it's not too late

You don't have to leave tomorrow
Don't you kinda wanna make it wait
I just need a little hope
That if you're gonna go, you'll take half the pain

Just string me along
One more time, one more time, one more
Leading me on
It's so wrong that it's right when you lie
Lie to me, tonight
Tell me that you love me
Even though it's all a lie, oh
Lie, pretty little lie
You don't need to mean it
I'll believe it when you lie, so lie

Li-li-lie
Li-li-lie
So lie, so lie
Li-li-lie
Li-li-lie
So lie (so lie), so lie (so lie)
Li-li-lie
Li-li-lie
So lie, so lie
Li-li-lie
Li-li-lie
So lie, so lie
