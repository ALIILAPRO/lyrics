		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You won't remember
All the countless times in the dead of the night
You were with me when no one else would be
I'd call you whenever
You would pick up like you ain't even tired
You were with me when no one else would be
And if I could, you know that I would
I'd give you my eyes so you can see what I do
And maybe you'd know it too

That there's something in the way that you walk
I can't put my finger on it
It's not just the way that you talk
'Cause there's so much of you I adore
Like the way that you love when you fall
And how you get up regardless
Yeah, you don't even know it at all
At all
And all you gotta do now is walk
And all you gotta do now is walk

And I find it funny that
Even 'til this day, you still look away when I try to
Compliment you on all of the things you say
And all the made-up phrases that you hate
But you let me say them anyway
And you're so in a way, but, babe

That there's something in the way that you walk
I can't put my finger on it
It's not just the way that you talk
'Cause there's so much of you I adore
Like the way that you love when you fall
And how you get up regardless
Yeah, you don't even know it at all
At all
And all you gotta do now is walk
And all you gotta do now is walk

All you gotta do, babe
Oh, and if I could, you know that I would (you know that I would)
I'd give you my eyes so you can see what I do
And maybe you'd know it too, yeah
And if I could, you know that I would
I'd give you my eyes so you can see what I do
And maybe you'd know it too

There's something in the way that you walk (Something in the way)
It's not just the way that you talk
Oh, oh
No, it's the way that you love when you fall (oh yeah)
And how you get up regardless
Yeah, you don't even know it at all (you don't even know, babe)
At all
And all you gotta do now is walk (and all you gotta do, yeah, all you gotta do, yeah)
And all you gotta do now is walk (all you gotta do, yeah)
