		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ugly?
A liar like me?
A user, a lost soul?
Someone you don't know?
Money, it's no cure
A sickness so pure
Are you like me?
Are you ugly?

We are dirt
We are alone
You know we're far from ?sober?
We are fake
We are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt
We are alone
You know we're far from ?sober?
Look closer
Are you like me?
Are you ugly?

Turn a blind eye
Why do I deny?
Medicate me
So I die happy
A strain of cancer
Chokes the answers
Are you like me?
A liar like me?

We are dirt
We are alone
You know we're far from ?sober?
We are fake
We are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt
We are alone
You know we're far from ?sober?
Look closer
Are you like me?
Are you ugly?

I don't care
You don't care
I do know
You're angry
You don't care
I don't care
Who are you?
Just like me?
Am I you?
You are me
I do know
You're angry
You don't care
I don't care
Who are you?
Like me?

We are dirt
We are alone
You know we're far from ?sober?
We are fake
We are afraid
You know it's far from over
We are dirt
We are alone
You know we're far from ?sober?
Look closer
Are you like me?
Are you ugly?
