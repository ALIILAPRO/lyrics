		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to believe Heaven was bulletproof
Only God can turn a red light blue (only God can turn a red light blue)
Been cuttin' me deep, dyin' to talk to you
Only love can push the blade right through

This love's an orphan callin' on deaf ears
And there's no afterlife, but if there is
It's late in the night time, so it's the right time
For sleep talkin', sleep talkin'

And now the heart's shot dead
Buried under each and every word unsaid
Twenty-four hours just go by, God bless
'Fore we let the ghost get away
One last communion, babe

So I let it go, nobody else around
Couldn't watch forever fall face down
So I turned my head the second it hit the ground
And I felt it, but it made no sound

This love's an orphan callin' on deaf ears
And there's no afterlife, but if there is
It's late in the night time, so it's the right time
For sleep talkin', sleep talkin'

It was a grand old age
Oh, yes, I know that nothin' broke can stay
But I couldn't bring myself to turn that page
Before I dropped a kiss on the grave
One last communion, babe

One last communion, babe
One last, one last, one last

One last communion, babe

It was a childish game
Who can light a candle in the cryin' rain?
No one could know about the mess we've made
I'm scrubbin', prayin' that the blood don't stain
I only whisper your name
One last communion, babe

One last communion, babe
(One last communion, babe)

One last, one last
