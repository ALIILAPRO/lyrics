		  Come my lady
Come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady
Come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and the looks to kill
Time is passing, I'm asking could this be real?
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough, I was lost, now I'm found
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want
So yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you, unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew
'Til I met you, see, I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash, paroled in police files
So yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, it's me and you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil, talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read but
You made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see, it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me
Uh-huh, uh-huh

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come and dance with me (yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me (yeah)
Come and dance with me
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Come and dance with me (yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me (yeah)
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
