		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walked a thousand miles
Just to turn around
Looking for my mind
Think I’ll leave it just for now

There’s no forever I know
But a lot to live
Feelings that I think I know
But it’s never clear

I’ve been talking to the moon
She’s been silent for all this time
Guess she takes me for a fool
That gets more the less I try
And I always take a bit of my soul
Spread it out wherever I go
I’ve been talking to the moon 
She’s been silent for all my life

Take the time you need
You don’t have to speak
Just give me a sign
Give me something I can see

I’m trying
I really do
sometimes I do these things but
I’m trying I really do
