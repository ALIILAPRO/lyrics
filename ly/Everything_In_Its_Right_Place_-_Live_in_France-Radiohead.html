		  Kid A, Kid A
Kid A, Kid A
Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything

In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
In its right place

Yesterday, I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday, I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday, I woke up sucking on a lemon
Yesterday, I woke up sucking on a lemon

Everything
Everything
Everything

In its right place
In its right place
In its right place
Right place

There are two colors in my head
There are two colors in my head
What, what is that you tried to say?
What, what was that you tried to say?

Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say
Tried to say

Everything
Everything
Everything
Everything
