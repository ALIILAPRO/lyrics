		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's got a bad attitude and loves to show it off
Body like a rock but his eyes they are so soft
Got a sweet little boy growing up is tough
A crazy baby momma she can't get enough
When it comes to loving me right, he's always wrong
I'm leaving you baby
My bags are packed to go
Don't try to stop me
My house is not your home
I'm leaving you baby
Don't act like you don't know
Don't try to stop me
Cause you're not changing my mind
You got a kiss so soft but a temper like an animal
Acting like a child throwin' tantrums in a cage you built
You lock yourself up inside writing love poems
Got 'em stacked up next to your bedpost
You got a lot of bad habits and I can't decide which one I hate the most
I'm leaving you baby
My bags are packed to go
Don't try to stop me
My house is not your home
I'm leaving you baby
Don't act like you don't know
Don't try to stop me
Cause you're not changing my mind
You may be Gemini
We don't see eye to eye
For more than half the time
You may be Gemini
We don't see eye to eye
For more than half the time
So, I'm leaving you baby
My bags are packed to go
Don't try to stop me
My house is not your home
I'm leaving you baby
Don't act like you don't know
Don't try to stop me nah nah nah nah nah
You're not changing my mind
