		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish you would say somethin' to make me change my mind
Got me feelin' like somebody else
I been so patient with you but you won't act right
And I'm tired of sleepin' by myself
What is we on? Boy, somethin' is wrong
Show me you want me too, mmh
Checkin' my phone every ten minutes
Thinkin' it's gon' be you, hmm

I just wanna fix this, but you don't wanna try
If you don't wanna be, why you always on my line?
Puttin' your peace over mine
Meet me in the middle

(Mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
(Mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional (mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional (mhm)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional

I been in touch with myself lately, I been kickin' it back
But you're workin' me so hard, I swear it's killin' me, yeah
Why we talk the most anytime we lay down in the bed?
Good head make you forget what you said
I been tryin' take it there, but make it clear, uh
You been fuckin' many weirdos, I'ma kill bruh
Sike, I'm playin'
I know it's been bad
It's been touch and go
It's been 'round and 'round
It's been loop-de-loop
We been here before

I just wanna fix this, but you don't wanna try
If you don't wanna be, why you always on my line?
Puttin' your peace over mine
Meet me in the middle

(Mmh)
Touch and go, oh, oh (mhm)
(Mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional (mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional (mhm)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional

Baby, do you hear me?
Tell me you still see me
All I know is 
I just need to know if you still need me
Baby, do you hear me?
Tell me you still see me
I just need to 
Have you closer every time you're near me

(Mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
(Mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional (mmh)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional (mhm)
Touch and go (mhm)
I'm too emotional
