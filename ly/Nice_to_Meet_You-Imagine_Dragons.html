		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was wandering up your street
And I was really hopin' to meet ya
But your girlfriend gonna delete my number, gone
I was wonderin' how your weekend's been
You wakin' up or you sleepin' in?
Your girlfriend's gonna be leavin' soon or not?

What could ever go wrong?
Sing your favorite song
She could come along
Oh yeah, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)
What could ever go wrong?
Summer's never too long
Our love's too strong
Oh yeah, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)

Anyway, it's nice to meet ya
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya

I was buyin' you those flowers
I was listenin' for hours
I was shuttin' up those doubters, ayy, yeah
She was jealous of our relationship
She hated that we were making it
She's smilin', but she fakin' it, yeah, yeah

Prayin' that we make it through the weekend
Wind is in the sail, but we are sinkin'
Hammerin' a nail, and now we're leakin'
Ayy, yeah, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)
Paintin' on the wall is something freaky
She been throwin' punches like a T.K.O.
Knockin' on the door and bein' sneaky
Get away, yeah (oh yeah, yeah)

Anyway, it's nice to meet ya (nice to meet ya)
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya (it's nice to meet)
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya (I hope to see ya)
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya

Anyway, it's nice to meet ya
She could be a Mona Lisa, should've seen her

I hope we meet again, oh
Hey, it's nice to meet
I hope we meet again, oh (true believer)
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya
I hope we meet again, oh (it's nice to meet ya) (to meet again) (I hope to see ya)
I hope we meet again, oh (true believer) (to meet again)
Anyway, it's nice to meet ya
