		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now summer is gone and we are drunk in love
But you're goin' away
Boy, don't get me wrong, I'm just a girl in love
And I want you to stay

So just fool me, fool me, fool me that is all I'm askin' for
And I want your body temper 'cause you won't be here no more
Can't you see my heart is beating like it never did before?
You're the one

Try to keep my heart from fallin', yeah
Uh, no way to resist it, no

And now summer is gone and we are drunk in love
But you're goin' away
Boy, don't get me wrong, I'm just a girl in love
And I want you to stay

So just fool me, fool me, fool me that is all I'm askin' for
And I want your body temper 'cause you won't be here no more
Can't you see my heart is beating like it never did before?
You're the one

I am dreamin' of a life
Where I will let you know
Why I love you so?

'Cause I'm meltin' in your eyes
I can let you know
Why can't I let you go?

So just fool me, fool me, fool me that is all I'm askin' for
And I want your body temper 'cause you won't be here no more
Can't you see my heart is beating like it never did before?
You're the one
