		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rise above gonna start the war
Whatcha want whatcha need whatcha come here for
Well an eye for an eye and an F for fight
Takin' me down as the prisoners riot

Got shackles on my wings on tight
Beggin' makin' compromise
Fast enough it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear

When I feel good I'm playin' under warm distress
Pass it up on a better day
Well you got whatcha want you never knew
Perfect gift from me to you

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Got shackles on my wings on tight
Beggin' makin' compromise
Fast enough it's hard to hide
Sometimes I want to disappear

(Raise up to your ability)
You never knew what I could find
What could come when we realize
Don't no one want to compromise

(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah I'm scared but I'll disappear
Runnin' around before I'll come with you
Like he's someone who lost his way

(Raise up to your ability)
I know that you wanna
'Cause it was easy to see
Of my ability

(Raise up to your ability)
Yeah you're undecided
Yeah so I can see it
Yeah I'm gonna wipe your mind

Focus on your ability
Focus on your ability
Now focus on your ability
Focus on your ability

Gain again what they want to steal
Gain again what they want to steal
Gonna gain again what they want to steal
Gain again what they want to steal
