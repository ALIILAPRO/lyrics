		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That night
I never came home
Wandering souls captured
My thoughts
Emptiness
Filled my mind
Urgency
Spoke her lies
In the confines
Of these, grey walls
I watched them
Move together
Taking me places
I cannot, remember (remember)
We have been, poured out
Into this loveless bride

How quickly I forget
That this is meaningless
How quickly I forget
(How quickly I forget)
That this is meaningless
(That this is meaningless)

In a world
Passing through
My fingers
I still chase the wind

How quickly I forget
That this is meaningless
How quickly I forget
(How quickly I forget)
That this is meaningless
(That this is meaningless)

What have I learned from yesterday
What have I learned from yesterday
