		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All was dark
It showed up
First light
First chapter begins with the light of sight
All the spark
Comin' down with no plans
The history bout to begin

Baby you and I are revolving
Around the darkness we're evolving
Between the time and space we're looking
Something that has never been explored

You and I
We're flying through the darkness
Even we don't know we're
Fighting for each other
I'm here baby
Please keep moving forward
Spread your wings and hit my heart

Wait
That's a big bang

You and I
We're flying through the darkness
Even we don't know we're
Fighting for each other
I'm here baby
Please keep moving forward
Spread your wings and hit my heart
That's a big bang

Yo yo my turn
Baby girl you're the satellite of my world
The universe that can never be describe with words
You are proton (what)
I'm a neutron (who)
And the almighty holdin' that electron
People say I love you to the moon and back (I love you)
But I'm just a man who will always got your back (hello)
Baby don't leave (don't)
Baby stay stick (please)
I'm a bit weird (what)
Baby please don't disappear (yeah)

You and I
We're flying through the darkness (we're flying)
Even we don't know we're (we don't even know)
Fighting for each other (yeah)
I'm here baby
Please keep moving forward (I'll find you)
Spread your wings and hit my heart (spread your wings)
And hit my heart make a big bang

You and I
We're flying through the darkness
Even we don't know we're
Fighting for each other
I'm here baby
Please keep moving forward
Spread your wings and hit my heart
That's a big bang
