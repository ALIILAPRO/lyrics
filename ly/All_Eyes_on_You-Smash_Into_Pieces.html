		  All Eyes On You

Killer for hire 
Soldier of fortune oooh
Gotta walk thru fire
For what´s important ohhh
And the Warriors blood
Through your veins is coursing
Killer for hire 
Soldier of fortune

The whole world's watching
Every move 
Still your heart so much to prove
Fight for all the things that you believe in
The whole worlds watching Every move 
Take your shot don't act a fool
Cause all you´ve got and all you´ll ever need

One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy take your aim (boy) yeah 
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do
All eyes on you

Do or die
You're a mercenary
One of a kind
That's your burden to carry
Go and Make them proud do what's necessary
Do or die 
You're a mercenary

Now the whole world's watching
Every move 
Still your heart so much to prove
Fight for all the things that you believe in
The whole worlds watching Every move 
Take your shot don't act a fool
Cause all you´ve got and all you´ll ever need

One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy take your aim (boy) yeah 
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do
All eyes on you
One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy take your aim (boy) yeah 
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do
All eyes on you

Now the whole world's watching
Every move 
Still your heart so much to prove
Fight for all the things that you believe in
The whole worlds watching Every move 
Take your shot don't act a fool
Cause all you´ve got and all you´ll ever need

One bullet in the chamber

One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy take your aim (boy) yeah 
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do
All eyes on you

One bullet in the chamber
Breathe easy take your aim (boy) yeah 
Ain't nobody gonna save you
So what you gonna do
All eyes on you
