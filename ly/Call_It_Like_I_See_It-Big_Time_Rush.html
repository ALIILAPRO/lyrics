		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you 
Oh, yeah
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you 
Oh, yeah

Pull up on you that's an intro
Just can't help it when you look like that
Spinning like a disco
Make me wanna make a demo track
Got me feeling like I'm retro
Leave ya friends in the friend zone, right?
You can meet me in the end zone, right?
Let's keep it simple, baby

I'm too upfront 
But from this point of view
(Pretty from the ground up)
Don't wanna say too much 
But what you trying to do?
Oh, yeah

I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you 
Oh, yeah
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you 
Oh, yeah

Out of this world like satellite
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight
Feels tonight, feels tonight

Out of this world like satellite
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight
Feels tonight, feels tonight, yeah

You blow my mind (oh)
This feels like Space X (Space X)
Defying science (yeah)
Floating out of this universe (ha)
Love you like I do it for a living
Whenever we're together it's a given (a given)
Never hit the pool but still you're dripping (dripping)
I don't wanna be rude but

I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you 
I just call it like I see it
And I'm liking what I'm seeing in you 
Oh, yeah

Out of this world like satellite (yeah, yeah)
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight
Feels tonight, feels tonight

Out of this world like satellite
Taking me straight to paradise
Got me up in my feels tonight
Feels tonight, feels tonight, yeah (in my feels tonight, yeah)

Call it like I see it so you know
Oh, whoa
C'mon, ha
Ooh, yeah
Ooh
