		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wears your number, but I got what you like
She's got you right now, but I'm still on your mind

I should've known better
You should've known better than me
Nights staying up talking
Told me everything except where was she
Now I've got you figured out
I'm tryna tell myself
I'm gonna stay away from you
I should've known better
You got a way that's gonna weigh-weigh on me

Oh-na-na-na, got me heavy breathing
Oh-na-na-na, every time we're speaking
Oh-na-na-na, got me real, real deep in
Want you so bad, baby, hurt my feelings
Oh-na-na-na, got me messed up dreaming
Oh-na-na-na, that your girlfriend's leaving
Oh-na-na-na, got me real, real deep in
Want you so bad, baby, hurt my feelings

I wanna do something I know ain't polite, like
Show up at your house without calling (calling)
Like doing something batshit, make you fall all in
She's where you're waking up
She's got you making up such pretty boy excuses
Ooh, but I know one thing (one thing)
She can't stop it happening in my mind (oh, na, na)

Oh-na-na-na, got me heavy breathing (no)
Oh-na-na-na, every time we're speaking
Oh-na-na-na, got me real, real deep in
Want you so bad, baby, hurt my feelings
Oh-na-na-na, got me messed up dreaming (messed up dreaming)
Oh-na-na-na, that your girlfriend's leaving (girlfriend's leaving)
Oh-na-na-na, got me real, real deep in
Want you so bad, baby, hurt my feelings

No, no
No, baby, hurt my feelings

She wears your number, but I got what you like
She's got you right now, but I'm still on your mind
She wears your number, but I got what you like
She's got you right now, but I'm still on your mind
