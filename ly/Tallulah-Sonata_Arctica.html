		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we used to look how sun set far away,
And how you said "this is never over",
I believed your every word and I quess you did too,
But now you're saying "hey, let's think this over".

You take my hand and pull me next to you, so close to you,
I have a feeling you don't have the words,
I found one for you, kiss your cheak, say bye, and walk away
Don't look back cause I am crying.

I remember little things, you hardly ever do,
Tell me why, I don't know why it's over,
I remember shooting stars, the walk we took that night,
I hope your wish came true, mine betrayed me.

You let my hand go and you fake a smile for me,
I have a feeling you don't know what to do,
I look deep in your eyes, hesitate a while,
Why are you crying.

Tallulah,
It's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over,
Whoa, Tallulah,
Find the words and talk to me, oh,
Tallulah,
This could be heaven.

I see you walking hand in hand with long-haired drummer of the band,
In love with her or so it seems, he's dancing with my beauty queen,
Don't even dare to say you hi, still swallowing the goodbye,
But I know the feelings still alive, still alive.

I lost my patience once, so do you punish me now,
I'll always love you, no matter what you do,
I'll win you back for me if you give me a chance,
But there is one thing you must understand.

Tallulah,
It's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over,
Whoa, Tallulah,
Find the words and talk to me, oh,
Tallulah,
This could be

Tallulah,
It's easier to live alone than fear the time it's over, over,
Tallulah,
Find the words and talk to me, oh,
Tallulah,
This could be
