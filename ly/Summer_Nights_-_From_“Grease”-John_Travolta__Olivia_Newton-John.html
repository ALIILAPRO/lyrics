		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summer lovin' had me a blast
Summer lovin' happened so fast
I met a girl crazy for me
Met a boy cute as can be
Summer days drifting away to uh oh the summer nights

Oh well, oh well, oh well-a, huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Did ya get very far
Tell me more, tell me more
Like does he have a car
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

She swam by me she got a cramp
He ran by me got my suit damp
I saved her life she nearly drowned
He showed off splashing around
Summer sun somethings begun but uh oh the summer nights

Oh well, oh well, oh well-a, huh
Tell me more, tell me more
Was it love at first sight?
Tell me more, tell me more
Did she put up a fight?
Dum do be do, do be do, do be, do be, do be dum
Do be do, do be do, do be, do be, do be dum

Took her bowling in the arcade
We went strolling drank lemonade
We made out under the dock
We stayed out 'til 10 o'clock
Summer fling don't mean a thing but uh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
But you don't gotta brag
Tell me more, tell me more
'Cause he sounds like a drag
Shooda bop bop, shooda bop bop, shooda bop bop, shooda bop bop
Shooda bop bop, shooda bop bop, shooda bop bop, yeah

He got friendly holding my hand
Well, she got friendly down in the sand
He was sweet just turned eighteen
Well she was good you know what I mean
Summer heat boy and girl meet but uh oh the summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more
How much dough did he spend?
Tell me more, tell me more
Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder that's where it ends
So I told her we'd still be friends
Then we made our true love vow
Wonder what she's doing now

Summer dreams ripped at the seams but oh those summer nights
