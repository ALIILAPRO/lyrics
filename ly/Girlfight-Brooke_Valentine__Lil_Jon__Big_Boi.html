		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy stop
It's about to be a girl fight
Some new shit yeah 
Brook Valentine

Uh huh uh huh
Big Boi
A Lil Jon!
Sending this one out to all the ladies who got beef with another bitch
Just walk to that bitch and tell her
What'd you tell her?
It's about to be a what!
Girl fight!

We 'bout to swang them thangs
We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

There she goes talkin' her mess
All around town
Making me stress
I need to get this off my chest
And if her friend want some then she'll be next

It really ain't that complicated
Ya'll walking 'round looking all frustrated
Want some plates come on let's make it
Ya actin' real hard but I know ya'll fakin'

I wasn't really the one who startin' this
Really don't know why you're talkin' shit
You're about to catch one right in your lip
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

I wasn't really the one who startin' this
Really don't know why you're talkin' shit
You're about to catch one right in your lip
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs'
We 'bout to swang them thangs
We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

We're on our way to the neighborhood
The reason why we comin' is understood
Me and my girls
We're down the ride

Steppin' your hair's pulled up and your girls outside
Don't be tryna call your cousin on me
Don't forget that I got some wit me
'Bout to go real far bout to swang them thangs
'Bout to el elbows all in your grain

I wasn't really the one who startin' this
Really don't know why you're talkin' shit
You're about to catch one right in your lip
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

Oh I know you don't want me to spend your dough
Oh I know
Oh I know you don't want me to spend your dough
But I'm about to own your things

Oh snap these bitches they act like cats
In the middle of the dance floor now they're preparing to scrap
They're takin' out their scrunchies, and they're pullin' off their press-ons
The one on the right is the girlfriend (What)

And the one on the left is the other woman
Someone please call the security these girls too purty
To get down to the nitty titty

I mean the nitty gritty
I mean her titties pretty
I'm trippin' bein' silly willy man

We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
We 'bout to swang them thangs
We 'bout to throw them blows
We 'bout to swang them thangs
Swang them thangs
It's about to be a what, girl fight!

We 'bout to throw them blows (don't act like you don't know)
We 'bout to swang them thangs (we're right outside your door)
(Saw you peeking out your window)
Now you ain't talkin' noise no more
We 'bout to throw them blows (don't act like you don't know)
(Don't act like you don't know)
We 'bout to swang them thangs
Saw you peeking out your window
Now you ain't talkin' noise no more

Bitch come outside
Subliminal

Don't act like you don't see me

It's about to be a, girl fight
