		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything's the same, but still all we know is changing
Slow me down, get a hold of me now
Years and years, my sanity scattered on the playground
I'll collect it again if I ever find my youth
If I ever find my youth

Like sand through the hourglass
It's slipping away right through my hands
I may have lost my chance
Will I know how to act if I ever find my youth?
If I ever find my youth

Every place, a different phase, glimpses of the old days
All the other kids are hanging in the trees
Wrote your name in colored chalk all over the pavement
I will do it again if I ever find my youth

Like sand through the hourglass
It's slipping away right through my hands
I may have lost my chance
Will I know how to act if I ever find my youth?
Will I ever find my youth?

All the moments, all the moments
All the moments I missed
Are they waiting for me, are they waiting for me?
All the moments, all the moments
All the moments I missed
Are they waiting for me, are they waiting for me?
Mh-mh
Mh-mh
Mmh-mh, mh, mh

Like sand through the hourglass
It's slipping away right through my hands
I may have lost my chance
Will I know how to act if I ever find my youth?
If I ever find my youth
If I ever find my youth
If I ever find my youth
