		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can make you feel it closer, baby, one more time
(One more time)
I can really feel you closing in, I stayed outside
(Stayed outside)
I love, I love, I love, no matter how, how much they take
(How much they take)
Something tells me we were chosen so we keep on trying
(Keep on trying)

She said I'm dumb, surrounded by strangers
When I hear your voice, I'm in too deep
Feeling undone, I can't be the only one
I wanna be forever young

I can make you feel it closer, baby, one more time (yeah)

Cigarettes, cigarettes
Sling it in the west, I got nothin' in my vest (in my vest)
Intimate, intimate
Sling it in my chest, may it never lay to rest (lay to rest, lay to rest)
We got here just in time
Don't get lost in this life
Levitate, levitate (levitate, levitate)
Like an atom, separate (like an atom, separate)
Elaborate, elaborate (elaborate)
Been a long time, I can see it on the paint
I can see it on the paint
I can see it on the paint

(Ooh)
(Baby)
(Yeah, ooh)
