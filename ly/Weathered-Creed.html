		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lie awake on a long, dark night
I can't seem to tame my mind
Slings and arrows are killing me inside
Maybe I can't accept the life that's mine
No, maybe I can't accept the life that's mine

Simple living is my desperate cry
Been trading love with indifference
And yeah it suits me just fine
I try to hold on but I'm calloused to the bone
Maybe that's why I feel alone
Yeah, maybe that's why I feel so alone

'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels and
It just won't heal

I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels and
It just won't heal

Naw, it just won't heal, no, no, no.

The sun shines and I can't avoid the light
I think I'm holding on to life too tight
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Sometimes I feel like giving up
Yeah, I said,
Sometimes I feel like giving up

'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels and
It just won't heal
I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels and
It just won't heal
It just won't heal, No.

The day reminds me of you
The night hides your truth
The earth is a voice
Speaking to you
Take all this pride
And leave it behind
'Cause one day it ends
One day we die
Believe what you will
That is your right
But I choose to win
I choose to fight
To fight

'Cause me, I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal

I'm rusted and weathered
Barely holding together
I'm covered with skin that peels
And it just won't,
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't
Covered with skin that peels
And it just won't heal.
