		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, uh-huh
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, oh yeah
Well I let into my home, you gonna leave my woman alone
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you

Now I'll be glad when you die, you rascal you, uh-huh
I'll be glad, oh I'll be tickled to death when you leave this earth it's true, oh yeah
When you're lyin' down six feet deep, no more fried chicken will you eat
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, oh yeah

Ah, you just ain't no good! oh, you dog

Now listen here, I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, uh-huh
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you, oh yeah
I'll be standin' on the corner high, when they drag your body by
I'll be glad when you're dead, you know I'm gonna be so happy when you're gone you dog
I'll be glad when you're dead, you rascal you
