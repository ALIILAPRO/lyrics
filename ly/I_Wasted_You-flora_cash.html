		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see what you're doing here...
you're looking to disappear 
again and I'm done
giving you some 
you belong to someone 

lips tell it to my ear 
everything I wanna hear 
but it ain't right
I don't even quite 
belong in your life 

so... go... no I don't want you to go
but I don't know what other avenue is open to us both
 
oh, what've I done
giving you my guilt only made me numb
I don't feel right...I feel like I wasted you 

ahh , it's over now
is it over now? i feel like i wasted you 

and baby ahh , it's over now
is it over now? i feel like i wasted you 

I know what you think of me
that I was always gonna be 
another one gone
leaving you alone 
but maybe you were wrong 

so... go... no I don't want you to go
but I don't know what other avenue is open to us both 

oh, what've I done
giving you my guilt only made me numb
I don't feel right...I feel like I wasted you 

told ya told ya
things have changed
I've been looking way back
I feel like I wasted you
