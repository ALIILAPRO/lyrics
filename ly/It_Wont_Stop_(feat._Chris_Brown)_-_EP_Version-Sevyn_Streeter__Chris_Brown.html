		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love when you pulling up in your Jeep
Bumpin' all your beats
J's on, with your shades on
Just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets
But when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no

Baby, hop in my ride
Ooh, it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down
With the doors closed
Got my hand up on my thigh
Drive slow
Take your time

Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way (way)
When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh oh oh, oh, oh)
(Oh oh oh, oh, oh) every day, every day

And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom, yeah (boom, boom, boom)
With every single part of me (oh)
My love for you is constantly (oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (oh)
On repeat
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom

I love when we pulling up to the beach (that beach)
Sand down to my feet (yeah)
Sun down, with nobody 'round
That's one hell of a scene
You rockin' my body (body)
Rock, rock the boat, Aaliyah (body)
Don't it sound familiar?

And you sound like, ah ah, aye aye
Lookin' up in space
It's just me and my bae
And we feels so amazing, oh
All night, whoa

Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way (way, yeah)
When you gimme that thunder you make my summer rain
(Oh oh oh, oh, oh)
(Oh oh oh, oh, oh) every day, every day

And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom (no)
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom, yeah (boom, boom, boom)
With every single part of me (oh) (me)
My love for you is constantly (oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (oh)
On repeat
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom

Every day, every day, I cant wait
You take my breath away from me
Here's my heart, you got the key
Put that on eternity
I love you 'til infinity
Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity

My everything
My everything
And when I think about it
Ooh, be making me wait, baby
I won't ever stop
My heart wont skip a beat, baby
And it'll keep goin' on, goin' on, goin' on (goin' on)

And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom (no, boom)
(I'm so in love with you, girl)
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom, yeah (boom, boom, boom)
With every single part of me (oh)
My love for you is constantly (oh)
Forever and ever on repeat (oh)
On repeat
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom (boom)
And it won't stop

'Cause, girl, I'm rockin' your body
Rock, rockin' your body (won't stop)
Rock, rockin' your body, baby (won't stop)
Said I'm rockin' your body
Rockin' your body to sleep

And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom 
And it wont stop, boom, boom, boom, yeah (boom, boom, boom)
