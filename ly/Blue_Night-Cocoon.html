		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you starting to miss me?
'Cause I'm starting to miss you
Are you staring at the sea?
It's what I'm doing too

Some kisses are painful
And I told you to be well
On a blue night in a pool
We choose not to care

I just kept coming back
But I don't know why it still makes me cry
There's no best goodbyes
Look at the sky, can you see this cloud?
Can you scream this loud?

You gave me shivers
But I live in a cage
A cold and quiet picture
Just a still image

And there is no abundance
So many words unspoken
Two hearts got racing
instantly broken

I just kept coming back
But I don't know why it still makes me cry
There's no best goodbyes
Look at the sky, can you see this cloud?
Can you scream this loud?

I'll stay a day or two
See if the night turns blue
I'll stay a day or two
See if the night turns blue

See if the night
Turns blue
