		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The second someone mentioned you were all alone
I could feel the trouble coursing through your veins
Now I know, it's got a hold
Just a phone call left unanswered had me sparking up
These cigarettes won't stop me wondering where you are
Don't let go, keep a hold

If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace 
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way

I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

Tell me what's been happening, what's been on your mind
Lately, you've been searching for a darker place to hide
That's alright
But if you carry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
I refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come home, don't let go

If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace 
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way

I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on

If you look into the distance, there's a house upon the hill
Guiding like a lighthouse
It's a place where you'll be safe to feel our grace 
And if you've lost your way
If you've lost your way 
I will leave the light on
And I know you're down and out now, but I need you to be brave
Hiding from the truth ain't gonna make this all okay
I see your pain
If you don't feel our grace and you've lost your way

Well, I will leave the light on
I will leave the light on
'Cause I will leave the light on
