		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward
Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both
For a wounded man will shall say to his assailant
"If I live I will kill you, if I die you are forgiven"
Such is the rule of honor

Broken the paradigm, an example must be set
Invoke the siren's song and sign the death warrant
This what has been wrought for 30 pieces of silver
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer

I am the result, what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking, I've been all ears

Words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
Words can be broken, so can bones
Execute the mandate
Mouth full of dirt
Your name removed from the registry
St. Peter greets with empty eyes then turns and locks the gate

I am the result, what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking, I've been all ears

Omerta

Cheaply venal, stupidly verbose
A slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat
Six feet under with no marker
Keep my name from your mouth forever

Free speech for the living, dead men tell no tales
Your laughing finger will never point again 

Omerta
Omerta
Sing for me now
