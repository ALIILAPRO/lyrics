		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin', oh
Keep choosin', oh

I seen them Instagram hoes and they love to party
I seen them Instagram hoes at the hotel party
I seen them Instagram hoes at Coachella party
I seen them Instagram hoes at the hotel party
I seen them Instagram hoes at that hotel party
And I ain't even think you know, you be everywhere
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
I seen them Instagram hoes at the hotel party
I seen them Instagram hoes at that college party
I seen them Instagram hoes everywhere I go

I'm like, "How you get in here when it cost a lot?"
Man, I know you ain't buy your ticket here
And I know a nigga flew your ass in here
And she tryna get chose by me
Yeah, she tryna come roll with me
Yeah, she wish she could leave
She just flew in and she wish and she could leave with me 
But she can't 'cause she with that nigga 
Yeah, girl, you can't 'cause you trapped with him
I don't know why you feel weird if you gon' choose on another nigga anyway (ayy)
Why did you come here if you gonna choose on me anyway?
Oh, no, man, you should've kept your legs closed
She got a baby on the way, ayy
I thought you was gon' wait for me
Oh, no, man, you should've kept your legs closed
She got a baby on the way
I thought you was gon' wait for me

She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin' on a nigga
She choosin', oh
Keep choosin', oh

I seen them Instagram hoes and they love to party
I seen them Instagram hoes at the hotel party
I seen them Instagram hoes at Coachella party
I seen them Instagram hoes at the hotel party
I seen them Instagram hoes at that hotel party
And I ain't even think you know, you be everywhere
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
