		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anne I always prayed
That you would come to me
But I'm afraid that I am not
Your everything
I'm glad to be with you
But I guess you're not
That's why I hate you
Cry cry oh my Lady
Desperately
Don't cry don't cry
Come to me with everything now
Crush them all
I'm here to get you
Your will your heart
Even your world
Burn destroy
So all that's left will be
Just you and me until the end
Anne how can you smile
Without me again?
You left me alone but I'll still
Smile for myself
You are all that I pray
For all of my life
It's you and me forever
Leave leave oh my lady
Get away from me
Don't leave don't leave
No one can take you from me
Crush them all
I'm here to get you
Your will your heart
Even your world
Burn destroy
So all that's left will be
Just you and me until the end
My love my Anne
You're all that I have left
Help me save me
I need you now
Desperately
I pray that you'll be mine
I love you more than anyone
