		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The story's the same, never changed
We've been here before
Yeah, we tried to be friends but it ends up being much more

And then we get insecure, build our walls
Then we play pretend, we don't care
No, it doesn't feel right when we fight
It gets us nowhere
But we're too scared

So we run and we run and we run
Further away from love
Look at what we've become
Yeah, we run and we run and we run
Losing the air in our lungs
What do we do about us?
We don't wanna fall out of love again, love again
Too afraid of another chance
We run and we run and we run
Further away from love
What do we do about us?

Do about us
Do a, do a
What do we do about us?
Do about us
Do a, do a
What do we do about us?

Oh, mile after mile
Getting tired of feeling this way, oh
Is it worth all the while
Can we find something to say? (Something to say)

Like, "Baby I can reassure, break your walls
We can just admit that we care"
'Cause it doesn't feel right when we fight
It gets us nowhere
But we're too scared

So we run and we run and we run
Further away from love
Look at what we've become
Yeah, we run and we run and we run
Losing the air in our lungs
What do we do about us?
We don't wanna fall out of love again, love again
Too afraid of another chance
We run and we run and we run
Further away from love
What do we do about us?

Do about us
Do a, do a
What do we do about us?
Do about us
Do a, do a
What do we do about us?
What do we do?
What do we do?
Do about us?
What do we do about us?
Do about us
About us, 'bout us, 'bout us, 'bout us
Do a, do a
What do we do about us?
Do about us?

Us
Us
