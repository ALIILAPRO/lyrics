		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep my windows open, front door's broken
I lost my keys i'm passed out on my futon
Gave back your DVD's it's been so long
But you're embedded to my thoughts
And all the songbirds sing sad songs
Oh, how I treated you so wrong?
I stay up all night long

I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustrating that we
Weren't meant to be i'm wasted on the sofa
Watching time fly, wearing loafers on my feet
Restless 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live
On the same street

You're in my melatonin dreams
My eyes can't read what's in between
'Cause it's been all just make-believe
And all I see are fantasies
'Cause I've been sipping on kava tea
(Sipping on kava tea)
(But it's all just make-believe)

Let's just say goodbye to the good times
Once and for all, just let them go home
I know they still give you butterflies
I'm stuck in an awful state of mind
Let it be known that I'm a lone soul
Lost from a romantic paradise

I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustrating that we
Weren't meant to be i'm wasted on the sofa
Watching time fly, wearing loafers on my feet
Restless 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live
On the same street

You're in my melatonin dreams
My eyes can't read what's in between
'Cause it's been all just make-believe
And all I see are fantasies
'Cause I've been sipping on kava tea

Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse je suis troublé
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily
Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse je suis troublé
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily

And I thought we could be
More than just friends
But I can understand your situation
I felt like you should know though
Since we're such good friends
I guess I'll just wait until you feel okay
Enough to see me like I see you
But until then
I can just be your guy best friend

I see you on the TV
You're in my melatonin dreams
I put my health beneath me
But it's frustratin' that we
Weren't meant to be i'm wasted on the sofa
Watchin' time fly, wearin' loafers on my feet
Restless 'cause I'm lost without you
Kinda awkward 'cause we live
On the same street

Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse je suis troublé
(You're in my melatonin dreams)
Weren't meant to be
But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily
(My eyes can't read what's in between)
Close your eyes, dance with me
Je suis rempli de tristesse je suis troublé
('Cause it's been all just make-believe)
Weren't meant to be
(And all I see are fantasies)
But it's okay, I feel your pain temporarily
