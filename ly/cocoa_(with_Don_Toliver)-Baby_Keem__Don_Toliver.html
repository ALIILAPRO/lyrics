		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sit down and drink some champagne with me and let me rap)

I'm ballin' with my friends
Starin' at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?
I might have to buy her OnlyFans
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothin' but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

Huh? Ugh, you toxic
Ah-ha-ha-ha, you toxic
You wanna stay? Don't stay late
Do you not like your house? Hate your place?
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
Spent half a mil' on Grandma house and then I zoomed
Got way more money than my peers, you would assume
In competition with myself, I cannot lose
What we gon' eat?
I don't do Nobu, baby, that's him, not me
We fuck, wake up, you go, we go too
London, we up, the top floor, eatin' soul food
I don't wanna eat nothin' else
It's new, I wanna see your room
It's new, I wanna fix your rules
It's new, bitch, I'ma, ha, ooh

I'm ballin' with my friends (hee-hee)
Starin' at the money in a trance (hee-hee)
Lil' baby, can I be your mans? (Hee-hee)
I might have to buy her OnlyFans (hee-hee)
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothin' but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

I love to spend it, she coppin' levitators (uh-huh)
I took her out to eat, I took her out to Denny's
She always call me plenty, drunky-drunky off the Remy (uh-huh)
Sometimes no callback and Donny tooked off on the Henny
I'm touchin' down in your city just to get it litty (uh-huh)
Better check the bar when we in the strip, we throwin' fifty (go, yeah)
Do not be the Ghost, you can't get too close (nah)
Shawty be doin' the most, one hand better ride that roll
Xannies got me goin' down, put me in my mode
I just ate lil' baby up, shawty taste like cocoa
Ten feet, down deep, then I'm hear and gone (cocoa)
Got to beat her out the sheets, you couldn't keep her home
Niggas pull up to the function, whip, I leave it on (pull up)
I leave it on, told you that I pack a punch

I'm ballin' with my friends
Starin' at the money in a trance
Lil' baby, can I be your mans?
I might have to buy her OnlyFans
Huh? She gave me pussy as just friends
I feel like nothin' but a middleman
I'm done, baby, I can't be your friend
You might give the pussy to my mans

Two freaks in the club, but they attitude trashy
Don't fuck with broke boys, so the opps down bad
Baby Keem in the cut, she know that's a hefty tag, huh
I just put the whole 702 on my bag
You ain't comin' home with us, please, don't you ask
I might throw a hundred ones, please don't be mad
Tit-for-tat, goin' back and forth is not my passion
Took a trip to Paris to post another caption
It's too much liquor, I get it, huh
Steakhouse, takin' out, eight-hundred-dollar dinners, huh
Baby, go ahead and grab that-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
Bruises on your knees
While I'm drinkin' tea
She gettin' t'd, I hate when you tease
Don't try to hide your ass, we'll tag a picture on your back, huh
If that pussy good, there's a chance I'll get attached
