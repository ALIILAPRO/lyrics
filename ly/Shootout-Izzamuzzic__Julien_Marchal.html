		  Who was the girl that was on your side?
I was the girl who was on your side

Who was the girl that was on your side?
I was the girl who was on your side

There was that girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There was that girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There is a girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There is a girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There was that girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There is a girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There is a girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side

There is that girl who was on your side
I was the girl who was on your side
