		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the time?
Seems it's already morning
I see the sky, it's so beautiful and blue
The TV's on but the only thing showing
Is a picture of you

Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit but the story's too thin
I thank the lord above, you're not here to see me
In this shape I'm in?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time

I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh, help me please, is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?

Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too

I'm spending my time, watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound, of tears of the clown
Prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

My friends keep telling me, "hey, life will go on"
Time will make sure I'll get over you
This silly game of love you play, you win only to lose

Oh oh 
I'm spending my time (spending my time)
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small, I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too

I'm spending my time (spending my time)
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound, of tears of the clown
Prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time

(I'm spending my time) I can't live without your love
I'm spending my time, uh I'm spending my time, my time, my time
The bed is too big without you honey, honey ? 
(I'm spending my time) oh oh
