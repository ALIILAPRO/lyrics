		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never felt alone 'til the late night
Never knew she was my home 'til the tears dried
Workin' on the karma, but it takes time
Innocence and sadness was a fine line
Better savor every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Maybe someday, you'll be happy for me, oh, I
Every minute, boy, steady rhythm joy

The reason I stay
Well, I need you today
Baby, I would bleed in your name
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be

I would've waited for you all night to talk for a minute
I'll sing into the cold dark night 'til you listen
Some people spend their life heads down, souls hidden
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be, well

Never felt alone 'til the late night
Never knew she was my home 'til the king cried
Lost inside the forest, but it feels fine
Innocence and sadness in the same night
All the love that just got stolen from your wide eyes
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Let your tears erode my shoulder like a cliff side
Heavy minutes, boy, steady rhythm joy

The reason I stay
Well, I need you today
Baby, I would bleed in your name
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be

I would've waited for you all night to talk for a minute
I'll sing into the cold dark night, you listen
Some people spend their life heads down, souls hidden
I'm tryin' to be who you need me to be

I'd do anything for smiles, I'd move Heaven and Earth
Nobody told me at the start how heaven can hurt
I'll be waitin' under streetlight at Bowery and 3rd
Know I was waitin' on ya, know I was waitin' on ya
Darlin', don't spend another second wonderin' what you're worth
Don't you ever get affected by the ways of this world
Wouldn't say my soul's protected, but there's somethin' at work
I was waitin' on ya, know I was waitin' on ya

Better savor every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Return me safely, turn me homeward at the right time
Every minute, boy, steady rhythm joy
Better savor every moment as it flies by
Every minute, boy, better live it, boy
Return me safely, turn me homeward at the right time
Heavy minutes, boy, steady rhythm joy
