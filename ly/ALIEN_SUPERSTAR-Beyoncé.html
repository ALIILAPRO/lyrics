		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please do not be alarmed, remain calm
Do not attempt to leave the dancefloor
The DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot test of the entire system

I'm one of one
I'm number one
I'm the only one
Don't even waste your time trying to compete with me (don't do it)
No one else in this world can think like me (true)
I'm twisted (twisted)
I'll contradict it, keep him addicted
Lies on his lips, I lick it

Unique
That's what you are
Stilettos kicking vintage crystal off the bar
Category, bad bitch
I'm the bar (ooh)
Alien superstar (unique)
(Hit me with a) whip, whip

I'm too classy for this world
Forever I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls
Ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched
I pay them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love (unique)
Ooh, baby, I'm

U-N-I-Q-U-E (unique)
Ooh, I'm stingy with my love (unique)
Ooh, baby, I'm
U-N-I-Q-U-E (unique)
Ooh, I'm stingy with my love (unique)

Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind in haute couture
Label whores can't clock, I'm so obscure (unique)
Masterpiece, genius, drip intravenous 
Patty cake on that wrist 
Tiffany blue billboards over that ceiling (unique)
We don't like plain, always dreamed of paper planes
Mile-high when I rodeo 
Then I come down and take off again (unique)
You see pleasure in my glare
Look over my shoulder and you ain't scared
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow, hike it in the air

I'm too classy for this world
Forever I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls
Ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched
I pay them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love (unique)
Ooh, baby, I'm

I got pearls beneath my legs (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
My lips, my hands, my hips
I got diamonds beneath my thighs
Where his ego will find bliss
Can't find an ocean deep (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
That can compete with this cinnamon kiss 
Fire beneath your feet, music when you speak
You're so unique 

Unique 
That's what you are
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar
Category, sexy bitch
I'm the bar
Alien superstar (unique)

We dress a certain way, we walk a certain way
We talk a certain way, we-we paint a certain way
We-we make love a certain way, you know
All of these things we do in a different 
Unique, specific way that is personally ours

We just reaching out to the solar system
We flying over bullshit, we flying over
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit, Casanova, superstar, supernova
Power, pull 'em in closer
If that's your man, then why he over here? 
(Unique)
