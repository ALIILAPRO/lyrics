		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and
I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and
I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
From every mistake
We must surely be learning
And still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted, too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
