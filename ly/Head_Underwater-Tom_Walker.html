		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ah-ah) woke up comin' out for air
Cold sweat on my skin, I was unprepared
Deep down, gettin' lost again
But it's me and myself that I'm up against
(Ah-ah) dark days that I've overcome
Why does this time feel like it's only just begun?
Downtown in the undertow
Chasin' highs when I'm feelin' low

(Mm) gotta let go, but I don't know how to let go
(Mm) how am I supposed to do this?

With my head underwater
I can't take it much longer
Head underwater
I'm at war with the monster
I'm strugglin' to catch my breath
Get it off my chest, but if it don't kill me, then
I'll get stronger

Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)
Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)

(Ah-ah) night comes and it's hard to sleep
Like my mind is a million miles apart from me
Can't count on the chemicals
They don't work when I made them the antidote
(Ah-ah) wild thoughts that I try to tame
Keep me numb how they run like the blood inside my veins
Uptown, I can see the light
But it's dark on the other side

(Mm) gotta let go, but I don't know how to let go
(Mm) how am I supposed to do this?

With my head underwater
I can't take it much longer
Head underwater
I'm at war with the monster
I'm strugglin' to catch my breath
Get it off my chest, but if it don't kill me, then
I'll get stronger

Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)
Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)

Holdin' on to hope I can make it out
Prayin' that my lungs don't fail me now
Holdin' on to hope I can make it out
Prayin' that my lungs don't fail me now
Holdin' on to hope I can make it out
Prayin' that my lungs don't fail me now
Holdin' on to hope I can make it out
How am I supposed to do this?

With my head underwater
I can't take it much longer
Head underwater
I'm at war with the monster
I'm strugglin' to catch my breath
Get it off my chest, but if it don't kill me, then
I'll get stronger

Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)
Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)
Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)
Oh, with my head underwater (head underwater, underwater)
