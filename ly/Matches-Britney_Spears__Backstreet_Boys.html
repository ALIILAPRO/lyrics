		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I taste you in the air
Your energy everywhere, uh-huh
It's borderline unfair
You know, I can see your brain, it's screaming my name, oh
And if it's up to me, I'd
I'd meet you in between my
In my Egyptian sheets
You know, I can see your brain, think you think the same, oh

Oh, if they dusted me for prints
They'd find you all over me, all you all over me (all over me)
Nothing ever quite felt like this
A fire is killing me
The good kind of killing me

Like playing with matches, matches, matches
This might leave some damage, damage, damage
The good kind of damage, damage, damage
Like playing with matches, matches, matches
Like playing with matches

Like playing with matches
Playing with matches

I like the way you dress, yeah
And then how you undress, yeah
Like it here on on your chest
No, there ain't no better place to catch my breath, yeah

Oh if they dusted me for prints
They'd find you all over me, all you all over me
Nothing ever quite felt like this
That fire is killing me
The good kind of killing me

Like playing with matches, matches, matches
This might leave some damage, damage, damage
The good kind of damage, damage, damage
Like playing with matches, matches, matches
Like playing with 

Ah, ah, ah
Want you good in the worst way
Ah, ah, ah
Want you good in the worst way

Like playing with matches, matches, matches
This might leave some damage, damage, damage
The good kind of damage, damage, damage
Like playing with matches, matches, matches
Like playing with matches

Like playing with matches
Playing with matches
Like playing with matches
Playing with matches
