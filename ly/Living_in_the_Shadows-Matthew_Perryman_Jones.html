		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoke is clearing out
All the circling lights, blind me
I've been running out
Now it's all just a fight, to breathe
I gave it all
Yeah, I gave everything

I will never break the silence
When I look inside
I don't have to hide
If you're looking, you won't find it
Who's the enemy?
Don't know what to believe

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows

Light is breaking through
The dark that is underneath
I know the truth 
But for you it's just out of reach
You took it all
Yeah, you took everything

I will never break the silence
When I look inside
I don't have to hide
If you're looking, you won't find it
Who's the enemy?
Don't know what to believe

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows

I will never break the silence
When I look inside
I don't have to hide
If you're looking, you won't find me
Who's the enemy?
Don't know what to believe

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows

Living in the shadows
Living in the shadows
