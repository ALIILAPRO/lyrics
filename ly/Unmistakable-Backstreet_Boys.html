		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Brian:]
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
You could be anyone today
Maybe I would recognize you On a crowded street

[AJ:]
Maybe you'll take me by surprise
Will you be the one I had in mind

[Chorus (emphasis on AJ):]
There'll come a day
When you'll walk out of my dreams
Face to face
Like I'm imagining
Baby how can I be sure
That you're the one I'm waiting for
Will you be unmistakable

[AJ:]
Unmistakable

[Nick:]
People say we're watching our lives
Through a glass
Desperately waiting on a chance
I know you're out there
Holding on, holding out for me

[AJ:]
How are we to know the time is right
What if you're here and I'm just blind

[Repeat Chorus (emphasis on Nick)]

[Nick:]
How can I know a song I never heard
How will I know your voice
When you haven't said a word

[AJ:]
How do I know how this will end
Before we begin

[Nick:]
Before we begin

[Howie:]
There'll come a day
When you walk out of my dreams

[All:]
Face to face (face to face)
Like I'm imagining (Like I'm imagining)
Baby, how can I be sure (how can I be sure)
That you're the one I'm waiting for (You're the one I'm waiting for)
Will you be (will you be)
Will you be (will you be)

[AJ:]
Unmistakable
Unmistakable
