		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it seemed forever stopped today
All the lonely hearts in London
Caught a plane and flew away
And all the best women are married
All the handsome men are gay
You feel deprived

Yeah, are you questioning your size?
Is there a tumor in your humor?
Are there bags under your eyes?
Do you leave dents where you sit?
Are you getting on a bit?
Will you survive?
You must survive

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Oh, what are you really looking for?
Another partner in your life
To abuse and to adore?
Is it lovey dovey stuff
Or do you need a bit of rough?
Get on your knees

Yeah, turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment
That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain
Saying love will kill the fear
Do you believe?
You must believe

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with (ah)
Got my back up
And now she's screaming
So I've got to turn the track up
Sit back and watch the royalties stack up
I know this girl, she likes to switch teams
And I'm a fiend but I'm living for a love supreme

When there's no love in town
This new century keeps bringing you down
All the places you have been
Trying to find a love supreme
A love supreme

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let 'em get you down
Everybody lives for love

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let 'em get you down
Everybody lives for love

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let 'em get you down
Everybody lives for love

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let 'em get you down
Everybody lives for love

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let 'em get you down
Everybody lives for love

Come and live a love supreme
Don't let 'em get you down
