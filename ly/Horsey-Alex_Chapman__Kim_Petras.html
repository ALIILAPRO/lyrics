		  Ride it like a (yeah)
Ride it like a (horsey)
Ride it like a-a-a
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a-a-a
Ride it like a

Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
R-r-ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya

G-G-G-G-Giddy up now
Got a big, then hit me up now
Shake it fast, I'm sittin' up now
Sugar cube, lick-lick it up now
Saddle up 'cause it's going down
Ride it like a triple crown
Yeah, I own it now
Bareback and I blow it out
(I can make you)
Put me on stage and my rate goes up
Put it in my face and your legs go up (up, up, up)
This horsey bout to buck

Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
R-r-ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
(G-G-G-G-Giddy up now)
(G-G-G-G-Giddy up now)
Put me on stage and my rate goes up
Put it in my face and your legs go up (up, up, up)
This horsey bout to buck

Buck, buck, buck, buck
Buck, buck, buck, buck
Buck, buck, buck, buck
Buck, buck, buck, buck

Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
R-r-ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
Ride it like a horsey
I can make ya
