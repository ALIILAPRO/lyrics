		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sunny, kinda funny, yeah)

I'm not what I want to see
Juggling insecurities
Locked inside my cage of shit
No I don't want to be clean
I don't want to be seen
I'm just waiting for someone to put me to sleep
Like I'm

I live such a lonely life
I don't like to go outside
Please, please fucking leave me be
No, I don't want dirty hands
I don't want to be mean
But I'm sick of meeting new people on my scene
Like I'm aggravated, motivated, never gonna graduate
I'm stimulated, overstated, I just wanna get sedated
On the contrary, I just wanna meet a nice girl
Messy, not too sketchy, keep me tied up in the right world
Segregated, situated, hangin' on sophisticated
Liberated, nauseated, I just want more medication
Individuality and blue light gives me headaches
Not changing for the better, I'm just changing clothes on weekends

Weather's nice outside
I think I'll close the window blinds, yeah
Sleep through my alarm
So that I skip the sunny part, uh
I'm not one to take a risk
I'll suck your blood, no anemics
Garlic or sticks, I'm vampiric
I just don't like the Sun
