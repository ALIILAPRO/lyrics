		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, dawg
This shit real, dawg
Niggas kill, dawg
Keep your steel, dawg
Or be a long-live dog
Straight up

I'm hangin' with killers, serial (Straight up)
Still in the hood eatin' cereal (Straight up)
I pray to these streets like they biblical (Straight up)
Jump off the rope, Rey Mysterio (Straight up)
Two ounces stashed in my stereo (On God)
You can get killed for subliminals (On God)
I'm a big dog, you a Cheerio (On God)
I don't gotta talk loud, bet you hear me though (Straight up)
Catch me now, I'm bad in traffic (21)
Way before the deal, I was trappin' (21)
Way before the deal, I was puttin' that fire on niggas just to feed my family (On God)
21 gang, I'm a bandit (Straight up)
I ain't have a father, he abandoned (21)
Me and mine, swear I went and picked up a lil' bit of weed and a nine (Yeah)
Partner damn near did a dime (Yeah)
And he still got another nine (Yeah)
Sent my boy 100 racks in the chain gang, nigga, 'cause money is time (On God)
Lately, I been on my grind (Straight up)
2500 on wine (Facts)
50 thousand on a suit, it's a good investment
Yeah, 'cause the deal worth dyin' (21)

Heart so cold, got a padlock, padlock
(Padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock)
He ain't in the field, he a mascot, mascot
(Mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot)
Chasin' this money, I can't stop, won't stop
(Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, won't stop)
Chasin' this money, I can't stop, won't stop
(Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, won't stop)
Heart so cold, got a padlock, padlock
(Padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock)
He ain't in the field, he a mascot, mascot
(Mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot)
Chasin' this money, I can't stop, won't stop
(Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, won't stop)
Make more than a teacher, I'ma drop out, drop out

I got rich nigga problems (Rich nigga)
Tryna put a 50 in my joggers (Won't fit nigga)
Knew you was a rat when we was toddlers (You a snitch, nigga)
You was always the cop, I was the robber (Lil' bitch nigga)
Born to be a leader, not follow (Follow)
Seventeen with a Monte Carlo (Carlo)
Y'all was in the house playin' Mario (Mario)
I was sellin' weed and went hollow (Went hollow)
That's just how we was raised (On God)
Before we came of age (Straight up)
Y'all niggas wanted some pets (21)
My niggas wanted some Ks (On God)
I had to sell a lil' weed to hit the flea market and buy some fake Ye's (Straight up)
That's where I bought my first grill (On God)
That's where I bought my first Js (On God)
'Member my mama was stressed (Damn)
Look at your son, now I'm paid (Goddamn)
She ain't really worry 'bout harm
She worry 'bout jail 'cause she know I don't play (Yes, ma'am)
She remember days, two-bedroom, Mini-14, and a SK (21)
I could leave today, she know that I'ma take a nigga with me 'cause she know I'm gon' spray (On God)

Heart so cold, got a padlock, padlock
(Padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock)
He ain't in the field, he a mascot, mascot
(Mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot)
Chasin' this money, I can't stop, won't stop
(Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, won't stop)
Chasin' this money, I can't stop, won't stop
(Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, won't stop)
Heart so cold, got a padlock, padlock
(Padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock, padlock)
He ain't in the field, he a mascot, mascot
(Mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot, mascot)
Chasin' this money, I can't stop, won't stop
(Can't stop, won't stop, can't stop, won't stop, won't stop)
Make more than a teacher, I'ma drop out, drop out
