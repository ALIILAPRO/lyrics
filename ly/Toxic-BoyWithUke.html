		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my friends are toxic, all ambitionless
So rude and always negative
I need new friends, but it's not that quick and easy
Oh, I'm drowning, let me breathe

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know

(I'm drowning, let me breathe)
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)
(I'm drowning, let me breathe)

But life is immaculate, backin' it up a bit
Countin' my hours and knockin' on wood
Avoidin' my opposites, chewin' on chocolate
Had a bit limited time, but I should
Be good for a minute, don't want to admit it
I'm runnin' on seconds, I'm rigid, I'm screwed
Don't know what to do, I'm thinkin' of you
I'm drinkin' up bottles and bottles of booze

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know

I fell into your river, that's where you told me lies
You said that I'd feel better, but this is where good guys die
You took my pride away, but you cannot take my life
I'll find another way out, but now you're takin' my life
Don't you see how I

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh, oh

I'm better off all by myself
Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else
Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help
But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cell phone
Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone
Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know
