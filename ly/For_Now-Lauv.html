		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I send you pictures all the time
Of our friends when they're too drunk and telling stories
I keep you right here in my brain
Even when we're waking up in different cities

I know it's hard to feel so close to someone that's so far away

But for now, I'll love you through the phone
And for now, our friends will fill this home
I'm really gonna miss you, but I'll kiss you through the screen
For now, 'til you come home to me

In the shadow of the moon
Found the memory of that night we were in Portland
Or the moment I told you
That no matter where we are, you're still my best friend

I know it's hard to feel so close to someone that's so far away

But for now, I'll love you through the phone
And for now, our friends will fill this home
I'm really gonna miss you, but I'll kiss you through the screen
For now, 'til you come home to me

I'm really gonna miss you but I'll kiss you through the screen
And if I had a candle I would wish you back to me
And next time that I see you I'll make sure you never leave
But for now, just come home to me
