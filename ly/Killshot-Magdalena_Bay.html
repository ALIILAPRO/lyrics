		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something chronic
Bit demonic 
I been on the late shift
All alone, staring at my phone 

Sin and tonic
Stupid promise
Something like a death wish 
All alone, stare into my soul

If I wanna stay alive
You should never cross my mind
Yeah I knew it 
I been through it

If I fall in every time
Wicked love will leave me blind
Yeah I knew it 
I been through it

Oh god
Can you make my heart stop
Hit me with your kill shot baby
I mean it so serious

God
Can you make my heart stop
Honey with your kill shot baby
I mean it so serious

Stolen nectar
Misadventure
Something like a death kiss
Growing cold, under your control

Knowing better
Twisted pleasure
Got me feeling breathless 
Growing cold, will you let me go?


If I wanna stay alive
You should never cross my mind
Yeah I knew it 
I been through it

If I fall in every time
Wicked love will leave me blind
Yeah I knew it 
I been through it

Oh god
Can you make my heart stop
Hit me with your kill shot baby
I mean it so serious
God
Can you make my heart stop
Honey with your kill shot baby
I mean it so serious

Come and get that honey
Sweeter than I ever knew 
Tell me that you love me
Love me till my lips turn blue

Oo ooo ooo ooo 
Walk into my bed like
How long
Got you in my head like 
How long, how long
