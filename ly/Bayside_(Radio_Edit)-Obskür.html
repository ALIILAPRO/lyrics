		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
(Let's keep it real fun, make that money)
And I drop bombs

And I drop bombs

And I drop bombs
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Just another product of the anger in the nation
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations (and I drop bombs)
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Just another product of the anger in the nation
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Just another product of the anger in the nation
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations

And I drop bombs

And I drop bombs
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
(Let's keep it real fun, make that money)
And I drop bombs

And I drop bombs

And I drop bombs
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Just another product of the anger in the nation
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
Peace to the crews from New York to L.A
Power to the people that struggle every day
Just another product of the anger in the nation
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations

And I drop bombs
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
And I drop bombs
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
And I drop bombs
Now I get paid, for my jazzy sensations
And I drop bombs
(Let's keep it real fun, make that money)
And I drop bombs
