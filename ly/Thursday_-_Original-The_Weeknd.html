		  Oh whoa, oh
Whoa whoa, ohh

I love her today
'Cause it's Wednesday, I won't be late, ooh
Now I need to know
If you're feeling when I'm free

Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, make sure
You are thirsty oh, on Thursday, baby
Get ready, oh, on Thursday
Why you calling? Oh, on Thursday
Just wait on Thursday, baby
Only Thursday

Whoa, whoa
Yeah, yeah
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

Girl I try, girl I try
I've been here for too long
Baby, don't cry
Why are you calling again? (Oh, again)
But it's not Thursday, baby, why you calling?

Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday
Sunday, but on Thursday, make sure
You are thirsty oh, on Thursday, baby
Get ready, oh, on Thursday
Why you calling? Oh, on Thursday
Just wait on Thursday, baby
Only Thursday
