		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me a fool for thinking maybe I could get over
Or I could be stronger
Than the fear in my mind
See mama always told me I was meant to be a light in the darkness
But I feel like a candle
Waiting for a flame

And she said
Keep on getting stronger
Keep on getting wiser my dear
Don’t give in to the forces
Don’t succumb to your fear

Oh sing with me now for the change I can become
Oh sing with me now for the change has just begun 

But do you see me oh Lord when I look to you for an answer
I need you to tell me
How to carry on
And he said

Keep on getting stronger
Keep on getting wiser my dear
Don’t give in to the forces
Don’t succumb to your fear

Oh sing with me now for the change I can become
(Help me stay strong)
Oh sing with me now for the change has just begun 
(Help me stay strong)

Show me now if I’ve lost my way
I reach for freedom from within my cage
Search for meaning whenever I’m afraid

Oh sing with me now for the change I can become
(Help me stay strong)
Oh sing with me now for the change has just begun 
(Help me stay strong)
‘
Oh sing with me now for the change that can be done
(Help me stay strong)
Oh sing with me now for the change has just begun
