		  I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out

Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side (hey)

From 광주 한 거시기의 gang, ayy
금남 충장 street 거긴 내 할렘 (할렘)
뉴런 입단 bounce with my team, ayy
춤에 뻑 가 워커홀릭 매일, ayy
십대에 밤 새우며 성장한 case, ayy
내 키는 춤으로 매겨 I'm okay, ayy
큰 비전 그려나가는 plan
꿈을 그려가는 애, 리듬 지르밟는 스텝, ayy (what?)
Popping, rocking, hopping, tutting, dougie, flexing, swaggin' (woah)
아직 매일 같이 한시바삐 하지 날 위한 일 (woah)
늘 나를 채찍해 당근은 트로피에
인생에 베팅해, 춤은 나의 cash
Hope on the street 이제 나만의 길
With Becky G on the side
Everyday I'm lit (get it!)

We always got love
For where we come from
So let 'em know what's up, ooh
No matter wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home, babe
Now that you know it
Let me see you (ooh, ooh, ooh, what, what?)

Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side (what?)
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side (what?)

Chicken noodle, o pollo con espagueti
Ninguna de estas mujeres tiene el flow que tiene Becky
Latinoamericana, soy de aquí
Carita de santa, pero freaky
¿Quién me va a decir si ya todo lo vi? (huh)
Donde yo nací no pensaban que una mujer iba a sobresalir
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (what, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (what, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do? (what, what?)
What you gonna do, what you gonna do
Look back at it, lights, camera, action!
Definitivamente la mejor de la escena
Word on the street we got the people reactin'
La gente que critica simplemente me dan pena, haha

We always got love (got love)
For where we come from (where we from)
So let 'em know what's up (ooh, yeah)
No matter wherever we go
Bring it back to this place called home, baby
Now that you know it
Let me see you (ooh, ooh, ooh, what, what?)

Go! I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
I let it rain, I clear it out
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
I let it rain, I clear it out
(Hold on) I let it rain, I clear it out (turn up!)

Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup
Chicken noodle soup with a soda on the side

Let it be your rain, and bring it out (bring it out), yo
Let it be your rain, just bring it out (ah)
Let it rain no more, I clear it out
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's get it (what?)
