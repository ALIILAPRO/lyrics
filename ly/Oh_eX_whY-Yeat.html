		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Let's go) I just walked up into Saks Fifth
Bitch, you broke, you just act rich (yeah)
I got bread like a sandwich
Oxy' got me sleeping, I took an Addy
And my twizzy in the kitchen
Like that boy Paula Deen (yeah, yeah)
If you don't fuck with the
Vision then unfollow me (yeah, yeah)
Racks way too fat, watch 'em stack
They as tall me (yeah, yeah)
And your bitch call me her
Dad, she want a bag, she give her all to me
I just took the Tesla, not the car
Yeah, that shit in the garage
It had to charge and bitch
I been that same kid since the start
If you switch up on the gang
You won't make it far
I don't reply to tеxts, I be icy
Just want S-E-X when I'm on that O-X-Y

Play my set likе a PS5 (yeah, yeah)
Got pressure, got PSI
Brand new diamonds I got from Eliantte
They got pee inside 'em
Yeah, I just been geeked up, yeah
For a year I been silent
Yeah, couldn't call up my label a year ago
Shit was so silent
Now they calling me back like, "Yeat
We wanna sign you" (Fuck 'em)
Yeah, I don't even need no bread
I got every designer call my twin my twizzy
Call my bitch my bizzy
Might just smoke this stizzy
And this Oxy' got me dizzy
Draco, it hold fifty, keep that here
No injury drank bad for my kidney but
I'm still sipping Trissy (And Wock')
Walked in with fifty thousand bitch
Sipping like literally
Walked in with shit that's unreleased
It came from Italy
I laugh when these kids flex
They just look like a mini me
You can't check up on the things I did
I swear I got no history
I ain't letting up the gas all year
I give 'em misery and I got a lot of fans
But at the top is where they picture me
(yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I fell in love with that Oxy'
That bitch a kid to me (yeah, yeah)
"No, I want the opposite, " she told me
"Put your kids in me" (yeah, yeah)

(Let's go) I just walked up into Saks Fifth
Bitch, you broke, you just act rich (yeah)
I got bread like a sandwich
Oxy' got me sleeping, I took an Addy
And my twizzy in the kitchen
Like that boy Paula Deen (yeah, yeah)
If you don't fuck with the
Vision then unfollow me (yeah, yeah)
Racks way too fat, watch 'em stack
They as tall me (yeah, yeah)
And your bitch call me her
Dad, she want a bag, she give her all to me
I just took the Tesla, not the car
Yeah, that shit in the garage
It had to charge and bitch
I been that same kid since the start
If you switch up on the gang
You won't make it far
I don't reply to texts, I be icy
Just want S-E-X when I'm on that O-X-Y
