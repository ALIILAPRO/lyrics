		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's that
Grey boy dripping up heavy with the vomit
Way I fuck the game keep ya flesh up in my pocket
Cleaning up all this pussy it's a shame I had to mop it
Then I'm gon cock it, fill it with toppings, all my phallus into yo noggin uh
Spitting that Grey Saliva old flow
Dripping it way up in ya ear hole
Gripping that dutch it's fulla' indo
Sipping that juice up with the gin tho
Eat the pussy pink slurping up on her lemonade
Fill the fucking sink jerking up on my fucking shween
I'm gonna paint the walls all over with ya membrane
I'm gonna spank ya moms fucking up on my sex swing
Busting thru her lip bout to give her the medusa
Used to fuck bitches in the PT Cruiser
Making bodies shake two 12" sub woofer
You can find that K all in my boogers
Stomping out the mud with clique
Keep my circle small cause I don't fuck with counterfeits
I'm in the studio so get the fuck up off my dick
I'm on my own wave so go and do your own shit
I'm on cloud 99 bitch I'm float away
Only love one hoe and her name is mary jane
99 blunts rolled imma smoke em to tha face
Then roll a hundred more cause all u mothafuckas fake
It's us against the world so get the fuck up out the way
You paying for your plays everything you do is fake
We get it on our own so we got no more time to waste
187 bodies laying on display
I'm a bad mothafucka with a fat dick
Swing it in the function while I'm smokin on some cat piss
These bitches think they bad but to me they kinda average
Imma head out grab a whip it then I crack it
