		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Throw it up, throw it up (throw up)
Watch it all fall out (fall out)
Pour it up, pour it up (pour up)
That's how we ball out (ball out)
Throw it up, throw it up (throw up)
Watch it all fall out (fall out)
Pour it up, pour it up (pour up)
That's how we ball out

Strip club and dollar bills
I still got more money
Patron shots, can I get a refill?
I still got more money
Strippers goin' up and down that pole
And I still got more money
Four o'clock and we ain't going home
'Cause I still got more money
Money make the world go 'round
I still got more money
Bands make your girl go down
And I still got more money
Lot more where that came from
I still got more money
The look in your eyes, I know you want some
I still got more money

Oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Oh

Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky

Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bills
I still got more money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got more money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got more money
Call Jay up and close the deal
'Cause I still got more money
My fragrance on and they love my smell
I still got more money
So who cares about what I spend
I still got more money
My pocket's deep, and they never end
I still got more money
I'm going dumb with all my friends
I still got more money

Oh
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Oh

Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky

Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
Throw it up, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour it up, pour it up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
