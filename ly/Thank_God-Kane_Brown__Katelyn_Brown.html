		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was lost, you found a way to bring me back
Needed forgiveness
You always gave me that
Girl, I'm a witness of your love 'cause you don't be giving up
And it's crazy
How you saved me

Hand on the Bible
Don't know how I got you
But I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for

So, thank God
I get to wake up by your side and thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine and thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do and He knew
Thank God for giving me you
Ooh, yeah, thank God
Thank God (oh) for giving me you 

Never thought I'd find an angel undercover
Made a change to everything
From my heart to my last name
Hey, hard to tell when he fell
That boy was Heaven sent
And every night when I close my eyes
Before I say Amen

I thank God
I get to wake up by your side and thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine and thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do and He knew
Thank God for giving me you, thank God
Thank God, yeah, yeah
Thank God, ooh

Hand on the bible
Don't know how I got you
I couldn't ask for more
Girl, what we got's worth thanking God for

So, thank God
I get to wake up by your side and thank God
Your hand fits perfectly in mine and thank God
You loved me when you didn't have to
But you did and you do and He knew
Thank God for giving me you, thank God, thank God
Thank God, yeah, yeah
Thank God
Thank God for giving me you
Thank God (ooh)
Yeah, thank God (oh)
Thank God
Thank God for giving me you
