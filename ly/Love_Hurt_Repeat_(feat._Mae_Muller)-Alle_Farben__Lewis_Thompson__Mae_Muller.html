		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the pain
Am I addicted to the games that we play?
I like the feeling of the highs and the lows
It's like my heart don't even beat 'til it's broke

It goes around and around, builds me up, tears me down
But I'll do it all over again
And so when I hear you say that you just need your space, it's okay
I'm used to wa-wa-walkin' away
Feels like I've been here before like a thousand times
You could fill a river up with the tears I've cried
Yeah, it always goes so wrong when I feels alright
'Cause every time it goes like

Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like

You live in my head
And all I know is that you ain't payin' rent
I like the feelin' of it killin' me slow
'Cause when your body's on my body, I know
(Body, I know)

It goes around and around, builds me up, tears me down
But I'll do it all over again
And so when I hear you say that you just need your space, it's okay
I'm used to wa-wa-walkin' away
Feels like I've been here before like a thousand times
You could fill a river up with the tears I've cried
Yeah, it always goes so wrong when I feels alright
'Cause every time it goes like

(Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like)
(Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like)
(Love, hurt, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat)
It goes like 
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like
Love, hurt, repeat, love, hurt, it goes like

Feels like I've been here before like a thousand times
You could fill a river up with the tears I've cried
Yeah, it always goes so wrong when it feels alright
'Cause every time I goes like
Love, hurt, repeat
