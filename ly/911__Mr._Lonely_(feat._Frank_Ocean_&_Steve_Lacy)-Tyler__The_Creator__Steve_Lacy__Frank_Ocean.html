		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me, call me, call me, uh
Call me, call me, call me, uh
Call me, call me, call me, uh
Call me, call me, call me
Call me, how you doin'?
(Call me) my name is Lonely, nice to meet you
Here's my number
You can reach me at, woo!

Nine-one-one (call me) call me some time
(You should call me) nine-one-one, call me some time
(You should call me, oh) nine-one-one
(Call me) nine-one-one

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My thirst levels are infinity and beyond
Sippin' on that lemonade, I need a Beyoncé
Can't see straight, these shades are Céline Dion
Sucks you can't gas me up, shout out to Elon
Musk, yeah I got a sold out show
Crowd wild out but don't matter 'cause you not front row
I've been lookin' for a keeper, listen to the speaker
If you fit description, hit me on my beeper
At that nine-one-one

Call me some time
Ring, ring, ring
Please bang my line, you know I'll answer
(Click) call me some time
Ring, ring, ring
Please bang my line

Nine-one-one (call me) call me some time
(You should call me) nine-one-one, call me some time
(You should call me, oh) nine-one-one
(You should call me) nine-one-one

Chirp, chirp
Chirp, chirp
Woke up in the burbs, burbs
With the the birds, birds
Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the night line
Work line
Dial nine

Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancin' to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at nine-one-one

I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga (I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck) 
Need to go somewhere and get some bitches or something
Weird ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree
I say the loudest in the room
Is prolly the loneliest one in the room (that's me)
Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (oh)
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
Woah, but that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (who)
The loneliest of them all (me)
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit
Check in on me sometime
Ask me how I'm really doin'
So I never have to press that nine-one-one

Oh! Damn! Damn!
