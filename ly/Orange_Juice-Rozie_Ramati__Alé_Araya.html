		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  her wings they spread out wide 
i give my heart to hands 
of the wind 
she got lost in the sky 
in it's blue tint 
while our eyes were fixed 

no pulse on my wrist 
between us my soul beats 
it leaped from my chest

we sit on the swing set 
from when we were kids 
the knowing hits 

i'll be good to you 
be 
good to you 
i'll be 

i can peel your orange baby 
be good to you
if you let me 

Hard to 
Hard 
Hard to make 
All these promises
All I wanna know is sun on my skin
Look at the light shining on my kin 
Reach for the leaves find the rays within 
And I promise you
I can be good good to you 

i can peel your orange baby 
be good to you
if you let me 
sometimes i think you don't want me
and then i remember 
it doesn't matter 
as long as i want myself
