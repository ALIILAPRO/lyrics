		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me, too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me, too

So oh, I should realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more

Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me, too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me, too
You love me, too, you love me, too, you love me, too
