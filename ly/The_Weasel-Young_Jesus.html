		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't believe the
Broken heart of the liar
Yet you need the weasel
To take the snake into its teeth
I buried evil
And watched the nightshade flower
I buried evil
And fed the darkness just
The same
The same

The humans eat up
The answers to their problems
As if the demon
Was just a passing melody
We watch the weasel
Die as it eats our poison
The snake and nightshade are
All that is left for us
To blame
To blame

You don't believe the
Broken heart of the liar
Who's left to grieve then?
When that heart's broken just
The same?
The same
The same
