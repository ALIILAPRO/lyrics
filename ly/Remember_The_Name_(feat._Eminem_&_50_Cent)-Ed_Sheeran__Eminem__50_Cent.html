		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I was born a misfit, grew up ten miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin'", like it's Christmas
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it gifted
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must have missed 'em

Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey

I can still remember (what), tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it (yeah)
Became an addict, funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell (what) if I'd prevail (huh)
And all I did was (what) put Nine Inch Nails (where)
In my eyelids now (what), I'm seein' diamond sales
Like I'm in Zales (yeah)
Without a doubt, by any means, if rap was skinny jeans
I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splittin' seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means no if, ands, or buts, are squeezin' in-between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit? The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it, then forgot what I said

It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy

Ain't nobody cold as me
I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean (ow)
Shinin' wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, that shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king, bring me fifty bottles
Tonight we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up is so real, we 'bout to get super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Hey, hey, hey (ow)
