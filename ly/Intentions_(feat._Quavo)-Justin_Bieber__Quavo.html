		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Shout out to your mom and dad for making you
Standing ovation, they did a great job raising you
When I create, you're my muse
The kind of smile that makes the news

Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch I can't refuse (no, I can't refuse it)

Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, no, you're the brand now

You're my rock, my Colorado
Got that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
That's how I feel
Act like you know that you are

Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread (whip it)
Heart full of equity, you're an asset (asset)
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, these are my only intentions (Quavo)

No cap, no pretending
You don't need mentions (no cap)
Got them saying "goals", they don't wanna be independent
Tell them to mind your business
We in our feelings
It's fifty-fifty percentage (fifty)
Attention, we need commitment
We gotta both admit it (both)
It's funny we both listen (both)
It's a blessing 'cause we both get it (both)
You the best thing and I don't need a witness (best thing)
I'ma find me a ring and pray it's perfect fitted (perfect)

Picture-perfect, you don't need no filter (no filter)
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer (oh)
Shower you with all my attention (I will)
Yeah, these are my only intentions (yeah)

Stay in the kitchen, cooking up, cut your own bread (you do)
Heart full of equity, you're an asset (uh huh)
Make sure that you don't need no mentions (no mentions)
Yeah, these are my only intentions (only intentions)
(That's all I plan to do, ooh)
