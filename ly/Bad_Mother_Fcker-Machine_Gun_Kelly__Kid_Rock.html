		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the line froze, what did I see?
A bad motherfucker standing next to me
With his eyes closed, told he can't see
Tryna follow orders, just gone and be free
Be free like a bird so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die
Be free like a bird so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die oh
Yeah, bad (bad) mother (fucker) 'til the (day) I (die)

I'm a Bad Brains, Bruce Wayne in the fast lane
Couple Js in the ash tray, style motherfucker
Tattoo'd back, man see the rap name
Take a bath in the champagne, wild motherfucker
Straight from the block, dawg, ducking shots walking to the store
Dollar for a Black & Mild, motherfucker
Blew up as a rockstar so I'm top floor
Throwing drinks on a cop car, foul motherfucker
The only number calling up my phone
Is from my dealer, swear that dude won't leave me alone
'Cause he knows when I pick up, I'ma cop a couple zones
And my girl know I ain't fuckin' 'til she roll me up a cone
I be keeping freaks in the home, yeah, Apollonia
Gold teeth like the Nolia, keep 'em on, yeah
I be rolling stoned, yeah I should be on the cover
With my middle finger screaming, I'm a bad motherfucker

When the line froze, what did I see?
A bad motherfucker standing next to me
With his eyes closed, told he can't see
Tryna follow orders, just gone and be free
Be free like a bird so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die
Be free like a bird so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die oh
Yeah, bad (bad) mother (fucker) 'til the (day) I (die)

Hey, Kid Rock, that's a bad motherfucker
Young Kells, that's a bad motherfucker (oh shit)
Detroit, y'all some bad motherfuckers
Cleveland, y'all some bad motherfuckers
Okay I'm reaching in my pocket
Got a condom and a hundred dollar bill
I can snort a rock or I can spend it on a pill
I be with some models that just flew in from Brazil
And they give me pussy 365 days a year bitch
I'm the type to never go to sleep
I'm the type to break a couple motherfucker's teeth
I'm the type to drop a hit of acid on the beach
And fly to Baltimore and scream, "Fuck the police!"
Do not get it twisted, this is not an image
There are legends told about the nights I'm in the buildings
It is not a question whether or not I'm the trillest
Every bitch is pressing me to get some cum on their acrylics
One point five million for my record deal and now I got the feeling
I could finally give a fuck about my parents' marriage healing (fuck 'em)
I'ma buy some mirrors just to put them on the ceiling
So when I wake up I see the realest motherfucker breathing

Be free like a bird so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die oh
Be free like a bird so today I'ma fly
Bad, bad motherfucker 'til the day I die oh
Yeah, bad (bad) mother (fucker) 'til the (day) I (die)

Yeah
Bad motherfucker 'til the day I die

Bad (bad) bad motherfucker
Bad (bad) bad motherfucker
Bad
Bad motherfucker 'til the day I die
Yeah, bad (bad) mother (fucker) 'til the (day) I (die)
