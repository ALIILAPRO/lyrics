		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never take anything for granted
Only a fool maybe takes things for granted
Just because it's here today
It can be gone tomorrow
And that's one thing that you'll
Never in your life ever have to worry about me
If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby, I love you
Girl, I love you
Just the way you are

Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair, hey there
You always have my unspoken passion
Although, I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
Don't want to work that hard, no love
I just want some, someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take 'til you believe in me
The way that I believe in you?

I said, "I love you and that's forever"
And this I promise from my heart, oh Lord
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are

I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard, no love
I just want some, someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are

I want you the way you are (love you just the way you are)

Don't go changing (love you just the way you are)
