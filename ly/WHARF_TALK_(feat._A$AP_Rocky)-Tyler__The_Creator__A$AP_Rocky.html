		  Call Me If You Get Lost

If God was here with us today
I think I know what He would say (some shit like)
"You're so beautiful, and your lips look nice"
Uh (not the, not the one on your face)

I got a new boat, you should come with
I got a section for your luggage
Bring some fiction and a nightlight
Record player and your top five
Where we goin'? We should get lost
No more questions, let the wharf talk, uh
(So there's a lot goin' on, make you comfortable)

I want you to come get lost with me
Ask you one more time before I tread too deep (I want you)
So can you make up your mind?
A wave's gonna come, wave's gonna come
So can you make up your mind?
A wave's gonna come (I want)

Unlike my friends, don't think I'll fall in love again
But I'll take a chance, seclusion isn't in my plans
Pack my shit up, time I headed back out 'cause my shit's up
Spend it all in one out, wanna split some
Some here with you right now
(Whatever you want)
If you got cold feet, it's warm by the water
You can turn your page around, let me be the author
Don't leave your destiny by the harbor
(Come on, it don't gotta be like that)

I want you (say yes), to come get lost with me
Ask you one more time (say yes), before I tread too deep (I want you)
So can you make up your mind?
A wave's gonna come, wave's gonna come
So can you make up your mind? (Flacko)
A wave's gonna come (I want)

Them bitches say I'm too conceited, they see the way I treat her
Be my se√±orita, put a ring up on her finger
Take her out the climate, somewhere to put her feet up
Neck Valentinin', rubies, diamonds, uh
Billionaire yacht party, climate was hot
Baby, if you seasick, we could stop at the dock
Yeah, lobster and calamari, caviar, um
Lots of luggage, private boarding, carry on, um (dance with us)

I got a new boat, you should come with (you should come with)
I got a section for your luggage (luggage)
Bring some fiction and a nightlight (nightlight)
Record player and your top five (top five)
Where we goin'? We should get lost (get lost)
No more questions, let the wharf talk (wharf talk)
Wharf talk, uh-huh

I want you (I want you)
To come get lost with me (make up your mind)
Ask you one more time (ask you one more time)
Before I go (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Before I go (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Before I go (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, when you gonna come?)
