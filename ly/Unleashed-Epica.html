		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep hiding
All colors fading
Defining
Time coming for me
Rescinding my inspiration
Rescinding consciousness

Back in the day, I can recall that
My thoughts were unclouded and sage
There was no black stain in the walls of my memories
Now there's a haze pushing me sideways
And leaving me nothing to gain
Taking me back, locking me cold in disparity
Where was I meant to be?
I'm feeling lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Release myself forever
I have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

Color declines
All that defines me
Is falling away far behind
Nothing to keep me with the time
The here and now
Where am I meant to be?
I'm feeling lost in a dream
Yearning again only to be myself

When I'm free
When my sun has set
Release myself forever
I have no regret
To be free
I'll exist again
No more lost endeavors
Nothing to contend
When I'm free

(Cure me, free me, help me, see me)
(No more worry, no more losing)
Time's just a concept (save me, near me, help me, hear me)
And always the first thing to fade (no more heartache, no misery)
Hiding in weakness(cure me, free me, help me, see me)
Nothing we can ever evade (no more worry, no agony)
Years are cruel, they break us (save me, near me, help me, hear me)
Bringing on decay and despair (we despair) (no more heartache, no despairing)
Awareness and perception (cure me, free me, help me, see me)
Something we can never repair (no repair) (no more worry, no repairing)

Freedom for me is all I'm really wanting, needing
Give me power to break out 
I can't hold on for any longer
My time has to come to an end it all

No one to blame
Fate's only random
It's nothing we'll ever explain
So it remains

Where was I meant to be?
I feel I'm lost in a dream
Long for the day I can be myself (free)
When will I be unleashed?
It's not the way to be
Yearning again only to be myself (unleash my consciousness)

Free (cure me, free me, help me, see me)
When my sun has set (no more worry, no more losing)
Release myself forever (save me, near me, help me, hear me)
I have no regret 
To be free (cure me, free me, help me, see me)
I'll exist again (no more worry, no more losing)
No more lost endeavors (save me, near me, help me, hear me)
Nothing to contend
When I'm free
