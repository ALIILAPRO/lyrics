		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it's too late
Come watch the waste
Dirty English sky
It's washin' me away
Open my lungs
I feel the Gods
How it tries to kill me
It's stingin'

Now you know we're all the same
Who have you been left to blame?
Everlasting summer again
It's all we've got left
It's all we've got

So here's your last kiss
Won't wanna miss this
Only piece of heaven I ever had
No, I don't think it's for nothin'
But I hope someday we're gonna get it back

Cover our eyes
It feels so nice
Lie on mornin' TV
It's easy

Say the wrong things the right way
Takes you to the highest place
It's time to embrace the answer
It's all we've got left
It's all we've got

So here's your last kiss
Won't wanna miss this
Only piece of heaven I ever had
No, I don't think it's for nothin'
But I hope someday we're gonna get it back

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Tomorrow is closed
There's no future anymore
We burned it all down, down to the ground
Oh, I saw it written on the bathroom wall
I've lost my place, we all have
But I hope someday we're gonna get it back

So here's your last kiss
Won't wanna miss this
Only piece of heaven I ever had
We're all sinking, you're gonna feel it
We're all reaching out to find another hand
No, I don't think it's for nothin'
But I hope someday we're gonna get it back

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
