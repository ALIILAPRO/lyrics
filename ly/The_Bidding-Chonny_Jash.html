		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been sleeping in a cardboard box
Spending every dollar on a losing lot
And even though I know it
Isn't worth much stock
You know it's better to have tried than not

Can you tell me who you're trying to fool?
I can't seem to find the
Point you're trying to make
And if you think that you can lie to me
Then I think you've made a big mistake

Going once going twice
Every madman has his vice
Some have lust some have greed
Some have intra-psychosocial envy
We've been here like a thousand times
Circled all around this dreadful carousel
You say that you're so cognizant
Of all the patterned lies that
You try not to tell
And yet you still continue
Putting in your dimes
And continue this revolving hell

And here he is: the piece of shit
Sitting, seething high atop his stolen throne
Glass is the house of the hypocrite
And yet you still continue arming stones

Going once, Going twice
Let me lend you some advice
Time is short, life even more
Yet you wage this silly war
Going twice, Going thrice
Guess this means we'll tie the rope today

See, I've been in total agony, relentlessly
Ever since you came around you came around

(Stuck, deteriorating helplessly, endlessly)

(The 'Ruler' of our Soul
Left never crowned, Forever bound)

Oh my god holy shit
We were there that was it
Did you see harmony if only temporarily?
The halves I reviled an attempt to concile
One more time, go again
No, this can't be the end

It was mean it was vile
Like a freak like a child
But for once, Heart and Mind
Had finally combined i believe i concede
You can finally enweave
If not for you or for him
Then please do it for me

'Cos I don't know how much more I can take
This creeping, seeping, sickly, sweeping

So please, won't you just attempt to be free
'Cos I think I can finally be me

We've been here like a thousand times
Fighting the other hemisphere
But maybe if we reasoned our rhymes
This dissonance could disappear
