		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shadows fall over my heart
I blackout the moon
I wait for you to come around
You got me dancing in the dark
(Dancing in the dark)
I've closed my eyes
But I won't sleep tonight

Baby, you
Should come with me
I'll take you to the dark side
Me and you
You and me
Do bad things in the night time

Baby, you
Should come with me
And we can kill the lights, hit the lights
With a blackout, blackout
Hit the lights with a
Blackout, blackout, woo

Black bird, black moon
Black sky, black light
Black, everything black
Black heart
Black Keys, black diamonds
Black out, black, everything black
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything black

In a nocturnal state of mind
Children of the night
But it's the only way of life
This black hole's pulling me inside
Of this black heart, the black soul
Underneath this black, black sky

Baby, you
Should come with me
I'll take you to the dark side
Me and you
You and me
Do bad things in the night time

Baby, you
Should come with me
And we can kill the lights, hit the lights
With a blackout, blackout
Hit the lights with a
Blackout, blackout, woo

Black bird, black moon
Black sky, black light
Black, everything black
Black heart
Black Keys, black diamonds
Black out, black, everything black
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything black

Baby, you
Should come with me
Me and you
You and me

Baby, you
Should come with me
And we can kill the lights, hit the lights
With a blackout, blackout
Hit the lights with a
Blackout, blackout, woo

Black bird, black moon
Black sky, black light
Black, everything black
Black heart
Black Keys, black diamonds
Black out, black, everything black
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything
Black, everything, everything black
