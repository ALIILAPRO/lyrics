		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Far away
Far away
Far away from here
Far away
Far away
Far away from here

Give me your hand
Give me your hand
And now I follow you
Give me your hand
And now I follow you
Give me your hand
Wherever you will go I will follow, oh

Give me your hand and I will follow you
Wherever you will go
Give me your hand and I will follow you
Wherever you go
I've packed my bag
Time to pick you up
We have to go
We'll leave now, right now
The streets are empty now
We could leave this town
And disappear
Where nobody can follow

Give me your hand
Give me your hand
And now I follow you
Give me your hand
And now I follow you
Give me your hand
Wherever you will go I will follow, oh

Far away
Far away
Far away from here
Far away
Far away
Far away from here
Far away
Far away
