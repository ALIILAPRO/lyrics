		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, let me sleep tonight
On your couch,
And remember the smell
And the fabric
Of your simple city dress

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

We walked around
'til the moon got full
Like a plate,
And the wind blew an invocation
And I fell asleep
At the gate,
And I never stepped on the cracks 'cause I thought I'd hurt my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare
That sucked me in
And pulled me under
Pulled me under

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you, 
I'm afraid, 

Oh, that was so real (Repeat: x6)

Real real real, 

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
