		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won't you come
Here you know the way, it's the one you made
Built it in the sky, all that's in your eye now not the same
Watch it tumble down, falling all around
Can you stand watching it undo all that's made of you?

You can stay where you are
I will wake you
I will wake you in the morning (in the morning)
You can stay where you are, so don't you worry
Don't you worry, keep on sleeping

Now you see, what you thought was yours could never be had
Take a look around, try to understand that
It's a game that you'll never hold onto very long, long
Where we are isn't just a place where everything remains

You can stay where you are
I will wake you
I will wake you in the morning (in the morning)
You can stay where you are, so don't you worry
Don't you worry, keep on sleeping

You can stay where you are
You can stay where you are
You can stay where you are

You can stay where you are
You can stay where you are
You can stay where you are

You are safe, watching it tumble down
Falling all around, around
Can you stand watching it undo
Fall instead of you

I will wake you
I will wake you in the morning
So don't you worry, don't you worry
Keep on sleeping
