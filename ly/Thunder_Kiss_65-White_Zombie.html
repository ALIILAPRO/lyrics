		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, sweet little sister's high as hell, cheating on a halo
Grind in an odyssey, a holocaust, a heart kicking on tomorrow
And a breakdown agony, I said an ecstasy in overdrive
We're riding on the world, thunder kissin'

Nineteen-sixty-five, yeah, wow
Five, yeah, wow
Demon warp is coming alive
In nineteen-sixty-five-five-five

Living fast and dying young, like an endless poetry
My motor-psycho nightmare freak out inside of me
My soul salvation, liberation on the drive
The power of the blaster, move me faster

Nineteen-sixty-five, yeah, wow
Five, yeah, wow
Demon warp is coming alive
In nineteen-sixty-five-five-five

You're all shook up, aren't you baby?
I never try anything, I just do it
Wanna try me?

Oh, shout (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, gimme that, gimme that, now
Yeah

Rollin' like a supersonic, another fool that gets down on it
Pig sweat a million miles, I've got a heart atomic style
Make it look easy, that's what I said
Blast of silence explodes in my head

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gimme that, gimme that, now
Gimme that, gimme that, now
Gimme that, gimme that, now
Give it back, give it back

Step to the moonshine frenzy, hail the resurrection
What's new pussy-cat? Can you dig the satisfaction?
Well, you can't take it with you but you can in overdrive
Yeah, some like it hot, yeah, twisted

Nineteen-sixty-five, yeah, wow
Five, yeah, wow
Demon warp is coming alive
In nineteen-sixty-five-five-five
