		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now

Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poison inside
And I, I feel so alive

Nobody can save you now
King is crown, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now
The only sound
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die

Nobody can save you now
King is crown, it's do or die
Nobody can save you now
The only sound
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
It's the battle cry
Nobody can save you now
It's do or die

Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
