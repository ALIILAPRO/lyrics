		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This autumn feels like funeral to me
The longest song of grief
And not for what has passed
But for what shall last

Exhausted nature is tragic and suicidal!
Oh how spectacular she is when she kills herself!
Death throes are slowly crawling to her toes
As the last leaf is falling off her head
I’m here with her undressed
With a few petals on my breasts
We shared opiates and let the landscaped do the same
I love your warmth but yet prefer to sleep in cold alone
We fixed our eyes up to the sky
To see a flight send us farewell

Goodbye!
May we see each other next time
So please, come back to celebrate this festival of life!

Then as now fly!
Today you reached the point of no return
Now cry! And then die!
Tomorrow I will meet you with your cells restored

Annual tradition of mass destruction
In the name of total reconstruction
My biggest source of confusion
The reason of decay and disillusion
Under permanent ice we found breathless paradise
No, we’re not dead
No, we’re not dead
Just enjoying coma

From the ashes of my roots the new me will rise to live again
This is poetry of youth, this is poetry of me and you!
