		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember racing home
Late at night, just to make it
While you were awake
And every night
I'll be up for hours now
Figuring this out

Hold me up, I can see it
Light beyond right now
Floating up to the ceiling
All that is, is right now

Can't remember anything from my dreams
When I leave them they all just recede
And I don't know about what's past here
I'll wait another night
Just wait another night

Shed me of my soul
Won't leave a thing behind
I say this every time
Yeah I say this every time
