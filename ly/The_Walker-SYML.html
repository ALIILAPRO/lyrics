		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When your heart rips out your chest
When your voice is trembling
Lift your head to the blood red moon
Hold your pain as you breathe

Time is short, like the old man said
Time is hungry like a wolf
It's natural, like the blood red moon
Bring your body close to me

Walk on with your burden
Walk on with your burden
I will walk with you
Walk on with your burden
I will walk with you
Walk on with your burden
I will walk with you

Dive into me, like some Great Lake
Move in me, like a ritual
Bathe in the light of the blood red moon
Raise a song in harmony

I will walk with you
Walk on in the middle of a dark day fighting through hell
I will walk with you
Walk on at the edge of the world where you find yourself
I will walk with you
Walk on with your burden, walk on with your burden
And I will walk with you
And I will walk with you
I will walk with you
And I will walk with you, walk on with your burden
And I will walk with you, walk on with your burden
I will walk with you

When your heart stills in your chest
When your tongue is poetry
Speak in the night to the blood red moon
Hold that moment close to you
