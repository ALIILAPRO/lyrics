		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Send my love to my enemies
While the kids on fire fall asleep on ketamine
Fuck those selfie celebrities
We got four left feet and I'm right where I wanna be

It's been a while since I've felt at home
First time in forever I don't feel alone now
Back to basics
Back on my bullshit
I'll get the hang of it, you be my blueprint

Call the cops somebody stop me
Fuck the world, we just made a copy
And we're the gods now, we say what goes
You got a problem well I got the pincodes
666 just make a wish
Please promise that you'll always have time for this oh!
Back to basics, back on our bullshit
I'll get the hang of it, you be my blueprint

Send my love to my enemies
A suicide timeline drowning in jealousy
Fuck that noise I don't wanna be
I don't want the best night, a good one's enough for me

I dragged my head, down those steps
Bang bang bang I don't wanna have sex
I make love - make time 
Good friends are getting hard to find
Make love, make time
Good friends are getting hard to find
Make love, make time
Good friends are getting hard to find

Call the cops somebody stop me
Fuck the world, we just made a copy
And we're the gods now, we say what goes
You got a problem well I got the pincodes
666 just make a wish
Please promise that you'll always have time for this oh!
Back to basics, back on our bullshit
I'll get the hang of it, you be my blueprint

Call the cops somebody stop me
Rip my sick head off of this body
We are the gods now, we say what goes
Off with the fairies now horns up and eyes closed

666 just make a wish
Please promise that you'll always have time for this oh!
Back to basics, back on our bullshit
I'll get the hang of it, you be my blueprint

Make love, make time
Good friends are getting hard to find
Make love, make time
Good friends are getting hard to find
