		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where does it come from?
When everything was outside
Busted and blue
How in the universe
Through the lithium
Busted and blue

I was asked by a computer
A shadow on the wall
An image made by Virgil
To rule over us all
To amplify the sirens
And to find real amends
I'm through the echo-chambers
To other worlds away

All my life
All my life
Beam a light
On me, I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my love
Be my love

Where do they come from?
The wires that connect to us
Weightless and fall on your body
'Till we're invisible
I'm with you throughout it, choose
Busted and blue

All my life
All my life
Beam a light
On me, I am a satellite
And I can't get back without you
Be my love
Be my love
Be my love
Be my love

Busted and blue
