		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loneliness is your only friend
A broken heart that just won't mend
Is the price you pay

It's hard to take when love grows old
The days are long and the nights turn cold
When it fades away

You hope that she will change her mind,
But the days drift on and on
You'll never know the reason why she's gone

Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love

You see her face in every crowd
You hear her voice, but you're still proud,
So you turn away

You tell yourself that you'll be strong
But your heart tells you,
This time you're wrong

Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love

You hope that she will change her mind,
But the days drift on and on (on and on)
You'll never know the reason why she's gone

Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love
Empty rooms, (you hope that she will change her mind)
Where we learn to live without love (but the days drift on and on)
Empty rooms,
Where we learn to live without love
