		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me home
Don't know where to go
Don't know how to feel
When I'm all alone
I'm invisible
You don't care at all

Don't blink, don't stare
When I'm here, you're there
Take me home
Can we just pretend it'll never end

For you I don't wanna be just another lover
You don't know how to give your heart back

I'm giving up on all my demons
Can't keep up with all their feelings
They string me along and I don't belong
Out of sight, out of mind

I'm giving up on all my demons
Can't keep up with all their feelings
They string me along and I don't belong
Out of sight, out of mind (giving up)

Used to give me everything I needed
Till I needed something to believe in, when you
Said forever guess you didn't mean it
Lying to my face and now I see it (yeah)

Don't blink, don't stare
When you're standing here, are you really there?
When the rain is gone
Are you moving on? 'Cause I'm holding on to you
Don't know how to give your heart back

I'm giving up on all my demons
Can't keep up with all their feelings
They string me along and I don't belong
Out of sight, out of mind

I'm giving up on all my demons
Can't keep up with all their feelings
They string me along and I don't belong
Out of sight, out of mind (giving up)

Out of mind, out of mind (giving up)

(Don't know how to give your heart back)
I'm giving up on all my demons
Can't keep up with all their feelings
They string me along and I don't belong
Out of sight, out of mind

I'm giving up on all my demons
Can't keep up with all their feelings
They string me along and I don't belong
Out of sight, out of mind

Out of mind, out of mind (giving up)

Out of mind, out of mind (giving up)
I'm giving up
