		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, look at me now, with those hollow eye sockets and smile
And it seems all a lie, what they've told me so far
And you, show me that life isn't all about extending your time
No, it's the perfect time for a bottle of wine

Why do I still care about all who might recall me
For everything dies, so does memory
And why, am I still surprised, about all who pray their sins away
Aren't they too a part of this grand ballet

When time occurs, don't make it right
Don't make me right, it's me to decide: this or that side
This or that side

Death suits you dear sir, like a beautiful coat, but then without all the fur
I wonder would it fit me? What would you have me prefer
Some people would rather not exist, they put a gun to the heart or a knife to the wrist
We are to think they aren't smart, it could be something I missed

Right then she kisses my skin, I don't know what this is or where to begin
This fills me up with bliss, Dont tell me this was a dream
And she shows me that life, isn't all about explaining your time
No it's the perfect time, to lay all night

When time occurs, don't make it right
Just don't make me right, it's me to decide: this or that side
I need your word, leave it aside
Just don't make me right, it's me to decide: this or that side
This or that side, this or that side, this or that side

You look at me now with that burning cigar hanging out of your mouth
And it seems all a lie, what they've told me so far
