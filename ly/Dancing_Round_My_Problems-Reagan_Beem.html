		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m not bipolar
I just have a hard time being
Consistently happy or sad
So maybe I am
I don’t really know yet
In the blink of an eye
One minute I’m fine
Then I’m ghosting my friends
When I get depressed

But I’ve been scared to see a therapist
So I’ll stay blissfully as ignorant 

Dancing round my problems
Dodging cause I’m scared that i’m the problem
That nobody can fix
And If i tried to
I’d let everyone down
So I’ve been
Dancing round my problems

I get over ambitious
And make stupid decisions that I know I’ll just say be sorry for
Cause I’m afraid of being bored
Couldn’t say that it Isn’t
But I’m a little suspicious
How my moods can swing me back and forth
Is this anyone else’s norm?

Dancing round my problems
Dodging cause I’m scared that I’m the problem
That nobody can fix
And if I tried to
I’d let everyone down
So I’ve been
Dancing round my problems

With all my highs
And all my lows
I’m so blind to letting go
With all my highs
And all my lows
Afraid that I might lose control
