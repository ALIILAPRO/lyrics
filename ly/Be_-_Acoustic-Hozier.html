		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be, be as you've always been
Be like the love that discovered the sin
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me
Be that hope when Eden was lost
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
And, lover, be good to me

Be as you've always been
Be as you've always been

Be, be as you've always been
True to the time and the place you've been given
Your heart in the world and a world there within
And, lover, be good to me
Be there and just as you stand
Or be like the rose that you'd hold in your hand
That grows bold in a barren and an uneasy land
lover, be good to me

And, be as you've always been
Be as you've always been
Be as you've always been
Be as you've always been
