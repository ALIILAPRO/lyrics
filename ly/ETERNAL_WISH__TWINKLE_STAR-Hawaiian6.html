		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under stars asking,
"What is eternity?"
Shining with life.
Even the stars
must someday die.
Under stars singing
up to the starlight.
"Really no choice."
"So I must change."
"Keep moving forward."
There's not a thing,
not one thing that
always stays the same.
Even the times change
and we will change, too.
But we are man.
And all is incomplete.
That's just the way it's okay.
Somehow we are shining on.
Keep this smile forever.
A glass heart forever.
A shining eye forever.
A weak forever. Youth forever.
Teenage spirit forever.
My life is not eternity.
My wish twinkled like a star.
And it has gone out.

There's not a thing,
not one thing that
always stays the same.
Even the times change
and we will change, too.
But we are man.
And all is incomplete.
That's just the way it's okay.
Somehow we are shining on.
Keep this smile forever.
A glass heart forever.
A shining eye forever.
A weak forever. Youth forever.
Teenage spirit forever.
My life is not eternity.
My wish twinkled like a star.
And it has gone out.
Beautiful tears forever.
Shining sweat forever.
loy of life forever.
Sentiment forever.
A pure spirit forever.
Rebel soul forever.
Live in peace forever.
Love forever. Goodbye to sorrow.
In eternity.
