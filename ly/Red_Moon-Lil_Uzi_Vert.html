		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watch the moon all the time thinkin' about you
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah

I watched the moon tonight and it was red (it was red)
I wanna live together 'til we dead
I tell myself that I can change (I can change)
Remind myself to not complain (to not complain)

But our love is not the same (woah)
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs (shut)
She says, "stop cryin', and get used to the times"

Not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't-

Lost myself and then I made my bedroom
Sittin' back thinkin', got too much head room (yeah)
Thinkin' 'bout my relationships that didn't even last (woah)
What I didn't get out of them, I swear that I'm tryna get it up out you (you)
You let me go and now I feel so light blue
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' at a red moon
I'm by myself and I'm just starin' (please)
Starin' (please), woah
The red, yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), oh, oh

But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't-
But our love is not the same
But our love is not the same
Our feelings change like seasons
You tell me that you leavin'
You go right now, then I ain't breathin'
She's on my mind all the damn time
I must be blind, I can't even read the signs
She says, "Stop cryin', and get used to the times"
