		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me, look at the length of my hair
My face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn what I do
After years of just hearing them talking?

I say I live in Rosemead
Really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, come into my bedroom
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore

Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

I say I live in Rosemead
Really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter
Doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head, but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

I mean, look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think I didn't ask for it?
I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this, so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Lookin' like a side piece at thirty-three?
God's a charlatan, don't look back, babe
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high (oh, my God)
Love me, if you love enough, you can be my light
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her you're fucking up big time

Your mom called, I told her you're fucking up big time

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high
Love me, if you love enough, you can be my light 
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her, you're fucking up big time

Jimmy, you should switch it up, maybe light it up (yeah)
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (like)
Jimmy, if you switch it up, you should light it up
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (surf's up)
Your mom called, I told her you're fucking up big time
But I don't care, baby, I already lost my mind
If you light it up, find me in the club
Your mom called, I told her you're fucking up big time

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy ride
Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, get me high
Love me if you love enough, you can be my light
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her you're fucking up big time
