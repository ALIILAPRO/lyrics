		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel, I feel myself fallin'
All the blood rushed to my head, mm-mm
Knee-deep into emotion
And you make me want to sink to oblivion

I want your love
To roll the dice
I put it all on you and I
Until the end of time
I want your love
To start a fire
And keep it burnin' through the night
Baby, until the end of time

They will say that we're insane
And in a way, baby, we are, mm-mm
When you pull me close underneath that light
From the moment I looked into your eyes
Saw what I've been searchin' for all of this time
This time, oh

I want your love (I want your love)
To roll the dice (to roll the dice)
I put it all on you and I
Until the end of time
I want your love (I want your love)
To start a fire (to start a fire)
And keep it burnin' through the night
Baby, until the end of time

'Til the end, 'til the end, 'til the end of time

I want your love
To redefine
The very meaning of my life
Undo the fabric of my mind
I want your love
To start a fire
And keep it burnin' through the night
Until the end, the end, the end of fuckin' time

La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la
La, la, la-la, la, la, la-la
