		  Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind
Outta my mind, outta my mind

Phew hah, hah, hah
Chyeah, woo hah, hah, hah
Uh, Psyke, chyeah hah, hah, hah
I'm rocking it out, I'm rocking it out
Hah, hah, hah, hah let's go, woo, uh

Uh, she wanna get in the starship
Switching lanes (Uh)
I'm droppin' the molly inside of my glass
The pink champagne (Pink champagne)
We did a week at the Shangri-La
Glad she came (Uh)
She wanna get in the starship
Switching lanes (Chyeah)
Hah (Uh) , hah, hah (Uh)
Hah (yeah) , hah (Woo, chyeah)

Dom BVLGARI, rocking Armani
Two in the morning, sipping the mud
Dropping the dub, keeping it fun
Keeping it G, keeping it kosher
Keeping it cool, Italian sofa, Italian stool

Italian stallion, Ferrari horse
Retaliate madder than ever before
If one of these niggas want take me for fool
If one of these niggas want
Take me for eediat
They preeing, they looking
It's nothing to see that
Shaky bar, but the45 peel back
Tony Soprano, it's organised murder
I'll fly your piano, your keys and bird
Fashion, I'm getting new season first
Smashing her inside a Rolls-Royce spur
I'm at the Mandarin, blue orders
I'm at the Mandarin, Shangri-La
Handling business with a baddie
I'm never paddling
I put my wrist in the ocean
Just so you can surf

Uh, she wanna get in the starship
Switching lanes (Uh)
I'm dropping the molly inside of my glass
The pink champagne (Pink champagne)
We did a week at the Shangri-La
Glad she came (Uh)
She wanna get in the starship
Switching lanes (Chyeah)
Hah (Uh) , hah (Hah) , hah (Uh)
Hah (Woo) , hah (Chyeah)

Dom BVLGARI, rocking Armani
Two in the morning, sipping the mud
Dropping the dub, keeping it fun
Keeping it G, keeping it kosher
Keeping it cool, Italian sofa, Italian stool

Hm, bet that she fuck for a Cartier (Brrat)
Off codeine and X, stuck to my dime
Yeah, I got a flight today (Ye)
She wanna fuck on me right now (Go)
Took the 'lil bitch to the (Hoo) hideaway
My niggas way too loyal
Fall when I'm gone, shit, that's right away
We was the ones outside getting shit done
Shipped out the Wock' for the
Truck like a pit'stop
Lil' bitty nigga a ho, he get pissed on
I put that model on X, she gon' lick some
I walk around with that blick
With that dick on it
Bad lil' bitch, I had put me some Rick on it
I just watched your watch have a tick on it
Ice on the watch, I just pull out
She sit on it
We get to tweaking and tripping off drugs
We get to tweaking and-, uh (Brrat)
We get to tweaking and tripping off drugs
I just had twenty one sluts
Beating that back, she just want my nut
Ling-Ling let me all in her guts
Brand new ring, Givenchy my jeans
She in love with the G6 beans us
