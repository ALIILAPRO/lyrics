		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some boys kiss me
Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't give me proper credit
I just walk away

They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (that's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash
Is always mister right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

(But what about romance? Oh please, listen up)

Some boys romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest then I
Have to let them be

Some boys try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play (no way)
Only boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day

'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
(Get it? Yes)
we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world 
And I am a material girl

'Cause everybody's living in a material world
And I am a material girl

'Cause they are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a (Material, I am a material girl)

Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material (oh oh)
Living in a material world (material)
Living in a material world
