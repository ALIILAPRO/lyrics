		<p>
		  Whoa! 
Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear 

Come on, and let me see your hands in the air 
With your air days when you jump off on your chair
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air

COME ON!

Whoa!
Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

COME ON!

Whoa!
Jah!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Test the bass!

Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear 

Come on, and let me see your hands in the air 
With your air days when you jump off on your chair
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air

COME ON!

Come on

Come on

Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air
Come on, and lemme see your hands in the air-a
Lemme see your, lemme see your hands in the air
It's a bomb in the walk just like a Nu-clear 

Come on, and let me see your hands in the air 
With your air days when you jump off on your chair
Get your freak on a-like ya don' care
Lemme see ya, lemme see ya, lemme see ya, lemme see ya (me see ya, me see ya)
