		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crave the machine
Revere the screen
Zoom in for flak and misery
Bleed some pixels

Shoot yourself
Pose for the dead
Have a near-life experience
In a hot air matrix

Now you're a star
Vain avatar
Feeding the beast
In your loud Egoland

You have become
Tool of a tool
Digital ghouls
Telling you to
Shut up and dance

Color a yarn and the crowds will gather

Noise
From the sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise

Please love me
See how I bleed
Please endure
I have such empathy in me

Hum, noise, hum
Beautifully numb
Tapping the quiet air
To have a meaning

By a carrion
Sad hologram
Lost in the maze
The real and human feel

Sunset is free
From this deity
The Earth has a real voice
Go out and get in

(I will follow)

Color a yarn and the crowds will gather

Noise
From the sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise

Feast your eyes on the black mirror
Feed the beast, join the gathering, tell a tale
Feast of fears is drawing nearer

Feast your eyes on the black mirror
Feed the beast, join the gathering, tell a tale
Feast of fears is drawing nearer

Beyond the human horizon
Something terrifying sleeps

Noise
From the sunless world
Your mirror is black, only a copy stares back
At a slave of brave new world
Noise
To decoy the human voice
Brain insomniac, paranoiac
Endless noise

Endless noise
Endless noise
