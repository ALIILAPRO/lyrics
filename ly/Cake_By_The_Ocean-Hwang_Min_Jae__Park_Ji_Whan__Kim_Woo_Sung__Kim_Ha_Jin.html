		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no see you walking 'round like
It's a funeral
Not so serious girl
Why those feet cold?
We just getting started
Don't you tiptoe tiptoe ah
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece (Ha)
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me (Ah)
You're a real life fantasy
You're a real life fantasy (Ha)
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously
Talk to me baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet
Craving whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Hot damn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste I'm begging yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy
On the dry land dry land oh
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece (Ha)
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me (Ah)
You're a real life fantasy
You're a real life fantasy (Ha)
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously whoah
Talk to me baby I'm going blind
From this sweet craving whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Whoa oh
Ah ya ya ya ya
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Ah ya ya ya ya
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Cake by the ocean (Cake by the ocean)
Cake by the ocean (Cake by the ocean)
Cake by the ocean (Cake by the ocean)
Cake by the ocean (Cake by the ocean)
Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece (Ha)
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me (Ah)
You're a real life fantasy
You're a real life fantasy (Ha)
But you're moving so carefully
Talk to me baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet
Craving whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me baby (Walk for me now)
I'll be diddy you'll be naomi whoa oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
