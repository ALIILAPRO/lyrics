		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me, how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?

How can you mend a this broken man? Yeah
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again, la-la, la-la, la

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow?

So how can you mend a broken heart? And mine is
How can you stop the rain from falling down? Baby
How can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round? And sometime I have to say, yeah, say

La-la-la, la-la-la, uh-huh, yeah
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, tell me
Help me mend my, my broken heart
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna live again, baby
How can you mend this broken man? Yeah, somebody tell me
How can a loser ever win? 'Cause, baby
Help me mend my, this old broken heart
I think I, I believe I
I feel like I got to, I feel like I wanna live again

How can you mend, ah, this broken heart? Somebody please tell me
How can you stop the rain from falling down? I know my clothes are all wet, tell me
How can you mend my, please help me mend my broken heart
I think I, I believe I, I've got a feeling that I want to live and live and live

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la
La
