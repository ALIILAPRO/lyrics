		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with (oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha (revenge)

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

(C'mon, can you take it back? C'mon)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think (no)
She's an actress, whoa (you know you deserve this)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (c'mon)

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing (no)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do (c'mon, c'mon)
Let's hear the applause
Come show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
