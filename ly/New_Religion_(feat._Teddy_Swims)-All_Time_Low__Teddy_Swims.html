		  New religion
I only wanna worship you, my 
New religion

I never thought myself a believer
But here tonight, I believe in you
We danced the demons away with tequila
Beneath the lights you were showing me a truth

That your sweat is my holy water 
(I'd drown in an ocean)
And your hips are the only altar
(I fall to my knees thinking)

I found God and we found heaven
On the bedroom floor, you're my, my new religion
It's been way too long since my last confession
On your bedroom floor, you're my, my, my, my, my

New religion
I only wanna worship you, my
New religion

This ain't gospel, nah, but what can I do?
I would be lying if I said I'm not dying to worship you (hey)
I got no problem being saved
Ain't no questioning my faith
Could be a sin to want you but worse to walk away

'Cause your sweat is my holy water
(I'd drown in an ocean)
And your hips are the only altar
(I fall to my knees thinking)

I found God and we found heaven
On the bedroom floor, you're my, my new religion
It's been way too long since my last confession
On your bedroom floor, you're my, my, my, my, my

New religion (I only wanna)
I only wanna worship you, my
New religion
New religion (I only wanna)
I only wanna worship you, my
New religion (I only wanna)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-ah

I found God and we found heaven
On the bedroom floor, you're my, my new religion
It's been way too long since my last confession
On your bedroom floor, you're my, my, my, my, my

New religion (I only wanna)
I only wanna worship you, my
New religion (I only wanna) (hey)
New religion (I only wanna)
I only wanna worship you, my
New religion (I only wanna)
