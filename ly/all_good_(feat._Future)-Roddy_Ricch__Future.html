Started off last week, it was all good
Watchin' Russell, Lebron James on the hardwood
Shawty told me to fuck her face, so it's all good
Bitch, it ain't no way I done went Hollywood
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef, how I been flippin' all this cake

Got a flock of famous hoes, took 'em to Barbados
Purple drink, sippin', bitch, why you on that K-Roll?
We ain't at no playground, I'ma show you how I play though
Bitch say I'm playin' mind games with her, she call me Plato
I want a motherfuckin' Janet Jackson
I'm sittin' in front of the TV, thinkin' I need a actress
Yo' wheel cost more than your front door
All I do is point at the ho and she come closer
Body like a two liter, ass fat as hell, nigga
Got a smart bitch at the 'partment, about to graduate from Yale
A high maintenance nigga, bitches compliment my nails
You know it ain't no goin' against the grain, I'ma prevail
This coupe talk, the spoiler lookin' like a damn tail
Only five hundred whips like this Demon out of hell
We outside, you been inside, nigga, we can tell
My crib double gated, save that shit for all my haters

Started off last week, it was all good
Watchin' Russell, Lebron James on the hardwood
Shawty told me to fuck her face, so it's all good
Bitch, it ain't no way I done went Hollywood
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef, how I been flippin' all this cake

My racks all good, my bitch all good
My wrists all good, my hood all good
Sittin' courtside higher than the moon
Rich nigga, fuck your bitch like a goon
Rolls-Royce Ghost floatin', tycoon
Pink diamonds, solitaries, cost me a stack of blues
Posted up with the robber, servin' dog food
Smoked 'em up, roll a opp up, knock him out his shoes
Standin' in the trenches with my jewelry
I put all my killers on security
My shooters, they evil, sittin' courtside with a heater
How the fuck I'ma ever go Hollywood?
I switched out my stripper with a pop star
In a vehicle too fast to stop for a cop car
I got pink diamonds on me, it was dirty Sprite
Bad bitch rockin' Louis, she look off-white

Started off last week, it was all good
Watchin' Russell, Lebron James on the hardwood
Shawty told me to fuck her face, so it's all good
Bitch, it ain't no way I done went Hollywood
My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef, how I been flippin' all this cake

My hoes all good, I fuck 'em all good
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
My pockets all good, my mama's still straight
A bakery chef, how I been flippin' all this cake
A bakery chef, how I been flippin' all this cake
My credit all good, bitch, I'm always good
