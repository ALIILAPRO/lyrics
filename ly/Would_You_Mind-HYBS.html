		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say hello
Don’t know why but I always get too shy
Every time
You are around

Tonight
I could pack all my love
send it like the wind blows

You know
If I could fly
I’de fly to your window

Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home


Tonight
I could pack all my love
send it like the wind blows

You know
If I could fly
I’de fly to your window

Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home

Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home
Would you mind it
If I’m gonna call you my home
Wouldn’t mind it
If I get to call you my home
