		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just robbed that nigga for his pack
Then I flex on him
I just made my lil' whip fast
'cause I flex on 'em (Skrr)
Now I'm somewhere in the Hidden
Hills 'cause I'm flexin' (yeah)
Saint Laurent draws on my ass
Spent a check on 'em (yeah)
She gon' let me hit it from the back
Now I'm flexin' (yeah, yeah)
Double park the whip in the back, bitch
I'm flexin' (yeah, yeah)
I got lists of hoes I wanna fuck
On my checklist (yeah, yeah)
Let me see that ass on
The headboard when you dancin' (yeah, yeah)

You can read my text messages (yeah)
Bitch, I do you way better than your ex man
(Woah) you a lil' nasty
I like when you talkin' reckless (Woah)
Go and live a little, then come
Home and get affection, yeah, yeah, yeah
She come over, yeah, she all in my phone
Yeah
She my centerfold, bad bitch, no cuddlebug
Uh when she need it, let her cuddle with me
(yeah, yeah)
If a ho out of line, she gon run up for me
Ayy (yeah, yeah)
Back it up, lil' bitch
You gon' have to earn your ransom
Night-night to her man
She say fuck him like he cancer (yeah, yeah)

I just robbed that nigga for his pack
Then I flex on him
I just made my lil' whip fast
'cause I flex on 'em (yeah, yeah)
Now I'm somewhere in the Hidden
Hills 'cause I'm flexin' (yeah, yeah)
Saint Laurent draws on my ass
Spent a check on 'em (yeah, yeah)
She gon' let me hit it from the back
Now I'm flexin'
Double park the whip in the back, bitch
I'm flexin'
I got lists of hoes I wanna fuck
On my checklist
Let me see that ass on ahead, woah
When you dancin'
