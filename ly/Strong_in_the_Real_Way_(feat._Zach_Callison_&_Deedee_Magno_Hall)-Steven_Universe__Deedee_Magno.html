		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Steven
Why do you have to look up to her?
Aside from in a literal sense
Don't you know that a power that big
Comes with a bigger expense?
And can't you see that she's out of control
And overzealous?
I'm telling you for your own good
And not because I'm

I could show you how to be strong
In the real way
And I know that we can be strong
In the real way
And I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock
And when I talk
It lights a fire in you

Who's ready to get buff?
I don't want to see your gut
I want to see your guts!

I can show you how to be strong
In the real way
And I know that we can be strong
In the real way
And I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock
And when I talk
It lights a fire in you
I want to inspire you
I want to be your rock
And when I talk
It lights a fire in you
