		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you miss someone you've never met?
'Cause I need you now, but I don't know you yet
But can you find me soon because I'm in my head?
Yeah, I need you now, but I don't know you yet

'Cause lately it's been hard
They're sellin' me for parts
And I don't wanna be modern art
But I only got half a heart to give to you

How can you miss someone you've never seen?
Oh, tell me, are your eyes brown, blue, or green?
And do you like it with sugar and cream?
Or do you take it straight, oh, just like me?

Yeah, lately it's been hard
They're sellin' me for parts
And I don't wanna be modern art
But I only got half a heart to give to you
And I hope it's enough

How can you miss someone you've never met?
'Cause I need you now, but I don't know you yet
But can you find me soon because I'm in my head?
Yeah, I need you now, but I don't know you yet

I need you now, but I don't know you yet
I need you now, but I don't know you yet
I need you now, but I don't know you yet
I need you now, but I don't know you yet
