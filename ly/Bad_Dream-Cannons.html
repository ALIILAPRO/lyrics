		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bought a ticket to your show
Did you see me, did you know?
I was standing in the back row
With the lights down low

I couldn't think of the right words
Now it's just too late
Now you're somebody's baby
So I'll be on my way

I been living in a bad dream
I been living in a bad, bad dream

I wish that somebody would wake me
Don't like this feeling, won't you shake me?
'Cause any more might break me
And you'll never know

I couldn't think of the right words
Now it's just too late
Now you're somebody's baby
So I'll be on my way

I been living in a bad dream
I been living in a bad, bad dream
Sleepwalking through a sad scene
I been living in a bad, bad dream

I been living in a bad dream
I been living in a bad, bad dream
Sleepwalking through a sad scene
I been living in a bad, bad dream
I been living in a bad dream
