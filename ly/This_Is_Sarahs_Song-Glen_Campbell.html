		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is what I wanna live for
This is where I wanna live
To give my life to you and to this feeling
That's alive today
And never let it go away
No matter what this is

This is, and how can I deny it
This is, and will not be denied
And you don't have to give an explanation
For the way you feel
I only wanna know it's real
No matter what this is

To give my life to you and to this feeling
That's alive today
And never let it go, never let it go away
No matter what this is
No matter, no matter what this is
It's everything that is
