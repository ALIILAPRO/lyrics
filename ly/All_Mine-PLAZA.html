		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me when the sun goes down
Ring ring, once you get downtown
In so deep, baby can't fix this
Like a user, baby I'm addicted to it
You get in my backseat
See you gettin' naked in the rear view
Ooh, I'm up here trippin' off you
Glance at the thought I want you
Blood is on my hands, but that never stopped me before, baby
Yeah, you know it's alright with me, with me, yeah

And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind
Tell me, did you get the news?
She ain't fuckin' with you no more
And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind
Tell me, did you get the news?
She ain't fuckin' with you no more

All, it's all mine, it's all mine
I gotta live by this, can't trust what these women do
He shoulda' never trusted you
You had me touchin' on your body
Tellin' me you belong to nobody
I know, everybody's playin' games
They all caught up in the blame, I know baby
So when you come around looking like this
Don't think I don't recognize that shit
But every now and then I see a woman that gets me higher
Put it all on me like that
So weak when you move like that

And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind (should've paid that woman)
Tell me, did you get the news?
She ain't fuckin' with you no more (she ain't fuckin' with you no more)
And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind (should've paid that woman)
Tell me, did you get the news?
She ain't fuckin' with you no more

And her body shakes
And you'll never know
When her body aches
But it ain't for you
If I only knew the truth
Man, I didn't want this all, believe me
I would've been so gone 
But her sex so strong

And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind
Tell me, did you get the news? (Ah, yeah)
She ain't fuckin' with you no more (no, she ain't fuckin' with you no more)
And I hit it, like it's all mine
Should've paid that, woman, more mind
Tell me, did you get the news? (Did you get the news?)
She ain't fuckin' with you no more (no, I'm telling you now)

And I hit it, like it's all mine (no, I'm telling you now)
Should've paid that woman, more mind (no, I'm telling you now)
Tell me, did you get the news? (No, I'm telling you)
She ain't fuckin' with you no more (she's all mine)
And I hit it, like it's all mine (and now you know)
Should've paid that woman, more mind (that you don't treat her right)
Tell me, did you get the news? (You don't fuck her right)
She ain't fuckin' with you no more (ooh, you're gonna lose her right now)
