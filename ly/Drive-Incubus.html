		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer?

It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
But lately, I'm beginning to find that I 
Should be the one behind the wheel

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there 
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

So if I decide to waiver my
Chance to be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive? Oh

It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way that everyone else gets around
But lately, I'm beginning to find that when I drive myself
My light is found

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there 
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there

Would you choose water over wine
And hold the wheel and drive?

Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there 
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings, I'll be there
I'll be there
