		  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, its more than I dare to think about

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, its more than I dare to think about

Every night
And every day
Just to be there in your arms
Won't you stay
Won't you stay
Won't you lay
Won't you lay

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, your lovin' is all I think about
I just can't get you out of my head
Girl, its more than I dare to think about

There's a dark secret in me
Don't leave me locked in your heart
Set me free
Set me free
Feel the need in me

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
