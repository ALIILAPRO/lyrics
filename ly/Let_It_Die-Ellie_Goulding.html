		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Toxicity slippin' to my blood stream
I give too much, you suck the life out of me
I fill my cup to drink you into someone else
And I blame myself

And I had a dream that we were perfect for each other
Sunset driving through the suburbs
We're goin' further
Then I hear a voice
And it says to me

When did you lose the light behind your eyes?
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry
And you're holdin' onto love for life
I think it's time to let it die
(Let it die, let it die)
(Let it die, let it die)
If you lose yourself (let it die)
You can walk away (let it die)
(I think it's time)

When did you lose the light behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes)
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry
And you're holdin' onto love for life
I think it's time to let it die

Not high for this, your heart has reached its limit
A counterfeit and now the lights are dimin'
I won't go back, spinnin' around under your spell
On a carrousel, oh

I had a dream that we were a beautiful endeavor
Sunset driving through the suburbs
But we go no further
Then I hear a voice (I hear a voice)
And it's askin' me (and it's askin' me, yeah)

When did you lose the light behind your eyes? (When did you lose, behind your eyes)
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry (oh)
And you're holdin' onto love for life
I think it's time to let it die
(Let it die, let it die)
(Let it die, let it die)
If you lose yourself (let it die)
You can walk away (let it die)
Oh, you let it die, oh, you let it die

When did you lose the light behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes)
Tell me why when there's no more tears to cry
And you're holdin' onto love for life
I think it's time to let it die
