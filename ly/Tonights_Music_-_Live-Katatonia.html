		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who could call my name without regretting
Who could see beyond this my darkness
And for once save their own prayers
Who could mirror down just a little
Of their sun

How could this go so very wrong
That I must depend on darkness
Would anyone follow me further down
How could this go so very far
That I need someone to say
What is wrong
Not with the world but me

Who could call my name without regretting
Who could promise to never destroy me
Tonight my head is full of wishes
And everything I drink is full of her
