Yeah, come on, yeah, come on, yeah (let's go)
Come on, let's go, come on, let's go
Yeah, come on, yeah, come on, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Come on, let's go, come on, let's go (turn up, turn up)
Your girl gon' pull up on me and she gon' cum on me (yeah, yeah)
Your girl gon' pull up on me and she gon' cum on me (yeah)
Yeah, come on, let's get it, let's turn up, let's go 
I took the Jeep to the front street
Your baby gon' get in the Tonka with me 
And she gon' sit in the front seat, yeah
I gotta take me a break from these opiates
Sometimes I open my eyes and can't see (can't see)
Still with my twizzy, look crazy, they pull up on them
They gon' leave some lil' pussy deceased

Yeah, I turned a five to a ten, yeah
I turned a ten to a hundred
Yeah, I'm so rich, it don't make no sense, yeah
Fill up then get to the muffin
Pull up in the Tonka, lil' bitch, I be crushing
Yeah, this ain't a Lamb' truck, this a Tonka
I was riding 'round serving birdies in a Honda
They thought that they had some space, we pulled up right behind 'em
I think I lost my damn mind, I gotta find one
We up now, no next in line, yeah, the gun got a problem

Yeah, come on, yeah, come on, yeah (let's go)
Come on, let's go, come on, let's go
Yeah, come on, yeah, come on, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Come on, let's go, come on, let's go (turn up, turn up)
Your girl gon' pull up on me and she gon' cum on me (yeah, yeah)
Your girl gon' pull up on me and she gon' cum on me (yeah)
Yeah, come on, let's get it, let's turn up, let's go 
I took the Jeep to the front street
Your baby gon' get in the Tonka with me 
And she gon' sit in the front seat, yeah
I gotta take me a break from these opiates
Sometimes I open my eyes and can't see (can't see)
Still with my twizzy, look crazy, they pull up on them
They gon' leave some lil' pussy deceased
