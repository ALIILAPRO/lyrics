		  (Yeah)
Come at your head, I come at your back, ha
Yeah, all of my diamonds, they muhfuckin' slatt, ha (slatt)
I'm fucking that twat, I'm fuckin' her hips, ha
Twenty four-seven, that big body flex, ha
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' bracelet, they on my head
Ridin' in that motherfuckin' coupe, she give me neck
Motherfuckin' chop it all off, I chop the head
Coming for the top, lil' bitch, I'm coming for they neck

You don't be inside of the Urus, I'm flipping it up and I'm flipping it back, ha
Yeah, I double my money, I doubled it up more than all of y'all had, ha
I don't be giving no fucks about none of this clout, bitch, I'm chasing a bag, ha
Yeah, I'ma flex, flex, flex on they neck, neck, neck, bitch, I'm flexing a bag, ho
Yeah, on a jet, jet, jet, get her wet, wet, wet, bitch, and she look bad, ho
Yeah, I'ma check, check, check, I'ma flip, flip, flip, yeah, I get a lot of cash, ho
Yeah, I got ten, ten, ten, 'bout to flip, flip, flip, 'bout to flip that Tahoe
Yeah, I got a blick, blick, blick, and it's lit, lit, lit, yeah, muhfuckin' die, ho

Lot of cash, big bag

Big body, big bag

Ran this back for the deal, muhfuckin' squeal, grabbing the wheel, uh
The Devil gon' call up my phone, lil' bitch, you know when it's real, uh (you know when it's real)
I sit in the circle, I'm walking around, I'm knowing the drill
Yeah, the Devil be calling my phone like every damn day, man, the Percies is real (Percies is real)
Pull up, it's late at night, man, I'm knowing the drill, man, I'm knowing the drill
All of this shit get hectic, shit get bad, man, you knowin' the feel
The henchman, my Twizz and my snake, they be in the field (buh, buh, buh)
A blessing, living this life out here, it's so real
I'm poppin' the muhfuckin' Percs again, I barely could feel
Yeah, I'm taking this shit all the way from the back, I'm knowing the feel
Yeah, I almost died to pour that shit, to pour that real
Yeah, I'm in the muhfuckin' broad Bentley, you don't know how it feel
Yeah, I'm in the muhfuckin' big ol' Tonka, swerving them wheels
Yeah, fuck that big ol', lil' ol' bitch, yeah, fuck that feel
Yeah, I bought the mansion inside the Hills, I'm living the film
Yeah, yeah, they want a best dressed junkie, yeah, on some pills

(Yeah)
Come at your head, I come at your back, ha
Yeah, all of my diamonds, they muhfuckin' slatt, ha (slatt)
I'm fucking that twat, I'm fuckin' her hips, ha
Twenty four-seven, that big body flex, ha
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' bracelet, they on my head
Ridin' in that motherfuckin' coupe, she give me neck
Motherfuckin' chop it all off, I chop the head
Coming for the top, lil' bitch, I'm coming for they neck

You don't be inside of the Urus, I'm flipping it up and I'm flipping it back, ha
