		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time I know, I know, I know
There's no looking back, it's all in the past
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, you keep saying
You hate me
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, so I let you

I let you do what you want and now you airing me out
They say a girl is a gun, but don't tempt me
'Cause I'm taking a chance, put the gun in my hands
Playing Russian roulette 'til she's empty
No, no, I don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young and hopeless
So, so, if I'm gonna die young
Just in case I die young, I wrote this

All these changes
Fuck it, don't make me play this
Break up, make up
And we do it again

This time I know, I know, I know
There's no looking back, it's all in the past
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, you keep saying
You hate me
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, so I let you

She's the poster that I'm hangin' in my mind, right
She's so sweet but she caught me on my blind side
You know it's true, I'm fucked up too
But you know I'm always comin' back for you
Because every time I see you, make me wanna rewind
Love went south so I'm throwing up a peace sign
You know it's true, I'm bad for you
That's just some shit that I've been going through

All these changes
Fuck it, don't make me play this
Break up, make up
And we do it again

This time I know, I know, I know
There's no looking back, it's all in the past
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, you keep saying
You hate me
I'll let you go, you go, you go
The love that we had is making me sad, so I let you
