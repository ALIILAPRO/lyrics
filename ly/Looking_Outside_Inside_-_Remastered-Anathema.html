		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this the one thought it was insane?
Coming down against it all
Didn't want it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it.
Twisted face of feigning beauty
Count the cost of suffering
Cannot see the day before you
Only feel what's deep inside
Trying to change it makes no difference

Didn't want it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it.
Didn't want it. Didn't need it. Didn't want it.

Let me go
Looking outside inside, craving for something
Hoping for anything, I'll believe in anything
Who has eyes that see, who wants to believe?
In something, in anything? In one thing, in freedom
Looking outside inside

Self assist pandemonium, broken promises
Died alive flying high, you caught me in your eye
Disintegrated incinerated, this is not how I want to be
Too much is coming through, someone please tell me what to do
Looking outside inside
