		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep losing friends and losing hours
I can't comprehend where i've gone wrong throughout my life
I've been sleeping in and skipping showers
Daylight's creeping in but i can't open up my eyes

So sick of heartbreaks mistakes losing my cool
These lazy Sunday's always thinking it through
Now i'm missing all the days when i had nothing to lose
And now i'm talking to myself and saying
I'm so sick of you

Haven't called back home in quite a while
Always on my phone but got no time to say hello
Wish I didn't have to fake this smile nah nah
Cause everyone i know just seems so happy on their own

So sick of heartbreaks mistakes losing my cool
These lazy Sunday's always thinking it through
Now i'm missing all the days when i had nothing to lose
And now i'm talking to myself and saying
I'm so sick of you

So sick of heartbreaks mistakes losing my cool
These lazy Sunday's always thinking it through
Now i'm missing all the days when i had nothing to lose
And now i'm talking to myself and saying
I'm so sick of you
