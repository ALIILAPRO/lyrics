		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could have been a sailor, could have been a cook
A real live lover, could have been a book
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock
I could be
Here and now
I would be, I should be
But how?
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

I could have been your pillar, could have been your door
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more
I could have been your statue, could have been your friend
A whole long lifetime could have been the end
I could be yours so true
I would be, I should be through and through
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first

I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute
A real live giver, could have been a boot
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock
I could be even here
I would be, I should be so near
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first
