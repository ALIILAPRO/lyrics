		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say
You're not good enough, you're not brave enough
You should cover up your body
Tell me, watch my weight
Gotta paint my face
Or else no one's gonna want me

Why do we say this to ourselves?
And even worse to each other?
Why do we say this to ourselves? Ooh

We gotta, get back to beautiful
Gotta, get back to beautiful
All these words, starting wars
Over who can hurt who more
Gotta, get back to beautiful

Back to beautiful
Back to beautiful
Back to beautiful
Get back to beautiful
Back to beautiful
Get back to beautiful

Judging who we love, judging where we're from
(Where we're from)
When did this become so normal?
Celebrating hate is now a commonplace
(Commonplace)
When did this become so normal?

Why do we say this to ourselves?
And even worse to each other?
Why do we say this to ourselves? Ooh
Why do we say this to ourselves? (Why)
And even worse to each other? (Ooh)
Why do we say this to ourselves? Ooh

We gotta, get back to beautiful
Gotta, get back to beautiful 
All these words, starting wars
Over who can hurt who more
Gotta, get back to beautiful

Back to beautiful
Back to beautiful
Back to beautiful
Get back to beautiful
Back to beautiful
Get back to beautiful
