		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How come you don't hear me Ma?
Tell me where your hearing went
How you just gon' leave me
In this social experiment?

Wonder why we take these pills
Everything we want is sick
Heart is like a toilet bowl
Mama, I want so much shit

Young, black, and I want that
Dreams of Americana
The girl I like want niggas to buy
So sorry Mama, but I wanna

So 6 in the morning?
Ain't rolling with no army
And I got that pink thing on me
Dreams of the money Mommy, can't take it from me Mommy

I've been waiting in the dark here all night
Waiting for some inspiration to pass by
Got my hair straight, and finally my vibes right
But that don't concern you

It's my turn now, it's my turn now
This might burn now, it's my world now
It's my turn now, it's my turn now
This might burn now, it's my world now
It's my turn now

Once he sees his people red
Time to get his peoples fed
Tokyo, appetite 
Yes, he is a sneakerhead

He packs man (Packs man)
Justice for his enemies
Yes, he's got those power pellets
Wop-wop-wop-wop, energy

Young, black, and I'm on that
Dreams of Americana
Perfect guy that's ready to rise
So sorry mama, but I wanna

So 6 in the morning?
Ain't rolling with no army
And he got that pink thing on him
Dreams of the money Mommy, can't take it from him Mommy

I've been waiting in the dark here all night
Waiting for some inspiration to pass by
Got my hair straight, and finally my vibes right
But that don't concern you

It's my turn now, it's my turn now
This might burn now, it's my world now
It's my turn now, it's my turn now
This might burn now, it's my world now
It's my turn now

I know this just leaves you confused
'Cause there's forces that's unseen
Okay, the least you could do
Take some time and check on me

Tell the preacher before he judge
Okay y'all, just say a prayer
Write it on a paper plane
Do me a favor, throw it in the air

You keep saying, "Quit the game"
Don't you know we play to win?
Racing with my lady friend
Chopped chopped on that 'Cedes Benz

So 6 in the morning?
You see them eyes is squintin'?
See the way them rims is spinnin'?
Dreams of the money Mommy, can't take it from me Mommy
Sorry

I've been waiting in the dark here all night
Waiting for some inspiration to pass by
Got my hair straight, and finally my vibes right
But that don't concern you

It's my turn now, it's my turn now
This might burn now, it's my world now
It's my turn now, it's my turn now
This might burn now, it's my world now
It's my turn now
