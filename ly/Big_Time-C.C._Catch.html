When I look at you - and everything you do
It makes me feel so good inside
Big time - anytime you kiss me I feel great
Big time - anytime you kiss me I can't wait
Can you still remember the things we used to say
Won't you please surrender
We're gonna make it right today

Got you - I want you - stay

Let's have a big time - you and I
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly
Let's have a big time - yeah-ah-ah
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly

A sign of love behind my tears
I'm gonna tell you that I'm misunderstood
I can't believe it you walked away
Do you remember - what we said

Let's have a big time - you and I
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly
Let's have a big time - yeah-ah-ah
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly

Now I'm next to you - so the dream is true
It makes me feel so good inside
Big time - anytime you kiss me I feel great
Big time - anytime you kiss me I can't wait
Feel that sweet surrender -just like yesterday
We are strong together
We gonna make it right today

Got you - I want you - stay

Let's have a big time - you and I
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly
Let's have a big time - yeah-ah-ah
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly

Let's have a big time
Let's have a big time - yeah-ah-ah
Big time - big time

Let's have a big time - you and I
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly
Let's have a big time - yeah-ah-ah
Just wanna have a good time - when we fly
