		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why I'm waiting for somebody who
Doesn't give a fuck about me

17 years on this Earth each day
Wanna be put in the dirt
Don't understand wanting to just show
You all my hurt
Hold me tight so you can tell me my worth
Heart break numbing it to end
The pain you play
The victim girl and I'll just play insane
Everyday i just gotta maintain
This pain but shit
I can say that depression at a game
Minds trapped and bruised stuck
In these blues verbally abused I look to you
Found you some clues sitting alone in my
Room tying the noose thinking of you
What works for me won't work for
You talked to the devil
Reminds me of you popping some
Pills i'm numbing myself
(I'm tryna get rid of myself)
I'm not sad i'm just alone looking
To the past man i need
To carry on remember to remember forget
In death then move on
Ascend to the top leave a
Message with your songs heart
Cold as ice from the ones
Who've done me wrong
Really made me suffer cut my
Wrist all day long People
Like free trials man they
Don't last that long pain makes you strong

Tell me why I'm waiting for somebody who
Doesn't give a fuck about me
Tell me why I'm waiting for somebody who
Doesn't give a fuck about me
Tell me why I'm waiting for somebody who
Doesn't give a fuck about me tell me why I'm
