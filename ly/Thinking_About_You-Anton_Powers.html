		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
I've been thinking about you, 'bout you
Been thinking about you

I, I've been thinking about you
Needing you tonight, night
Don't even have to tell you, oh
I, I ain't leaving here without you by my side, side, yeah
I'll never let you go
Something about you makes me wanna lose control
Lose control
I, I've been thinking about you
Needing you tonight, night, yeah

Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
I've been thinking about you, 'bout you
Been thinking about you
Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
Lately all I need
I'm gonna be there

Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
I've been thinking about you, 'bout you
Been thinking about you
Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
Lately all I need
I'm gonna be there

(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you
(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you
(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you
(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you

I, I've been thinking about you
Needing you tonight, night
Don't even have to tell you, oh
I, I ain't leaving here without you by my side, side, yeah

Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
I've been thinking about you, 'bout you
Been thinking about you
Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
Lately all I need
I'm gonna be there

Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
I've been thinking about you, 'bout you
Been thinking about you
Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
Lately all I need
I'm gonna be there

(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you
(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you
(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you
(Lately all I need)
Been thinking about you

Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
I've been thinking about you, 'bout you
Been thinking about you
Feel like it's so good
Feel, feel like it's so good
Keep moving on
Lately all I need
I'm gonna be there
