		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the heat of the moment
When you're all alone and out of breath
What's keepin' you goin?
What do you see up in your head?
When your eyes are closing
Where do you wish you were instead?
You got me hanging by a thread, yeah
Oh, tell me now

Who do you love?
Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love?
Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

Who do you love?
Talk to me girl, tell me who you love
Tell it to me right now, show me, who do you love?
Number one girl, you're the one I love
Come on, come on, baby, baby tell me, who do you love?
Talk to me girl, tell me who you love
Tell it to me right now, show me, who do you love?
Number one girl, you're the one I love
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Ayy, I'ma need me a new thing (thing)
He ain't believe his boo thing
Show me the 'Titty Boi', 2 Chainz (whoo)
Now the beef cookin' like Gordon Ramsay (Ramsay)
We should be somewhere that's hot and sandy (sandy)
Used to post up in New York, like Marcus Camby (Camby)
My two tings fighting, like Monica and Brandy (Brandy)
Now, now in that two door, ooh, wait (wait)
They're asking who you love like Cool J (Cool J)
'80s baby down the middle, like KD
And1, that's my other lane (whoo)
Them boys is next, Montana, Monsta X

Who do you love?
Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love?
Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who? (Say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who?
Who do you love? Who do you love? (Oh baby)
Who do you love? Who? (say who do you love)

Who do you love?
Talk to me girl, tell me who you love
Tell it to me right now, show me, who do you love?
Number one girl, you're the one I love
Come on, come on, baby, baby tell me, who do you love?
Talk to me girl, tell me who you love
Tell it to me right now, show me, who do you love?
Number one girl, you're the one I love
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Who do you love?
Is it him or me?
'Cause I can't take the pressure anymore
Who do you love?
Girl, it's killin' me
If you can't say that I'm the one for sure
Then I'm walkin' out the door

Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who? (Say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who?
Who do you love? Who do you love? (Oh baby)
Who do you love? Who? (say who do you love)
Who do you love? Who do you love?
Who do you love? Who?
