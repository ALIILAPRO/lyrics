		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sha, sha, sha

I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear
My dear

The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it, if you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here

The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, when you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you

And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like

The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

Sha, sha, you do, ohh, ooh
La, la, la
Ooh, ooh
