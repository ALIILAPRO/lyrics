		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My feet are not enough 
My feet are not enough
My feet are not enough
My feet are not enough

To save me 
To save me 

His search is not enough 
His search is not enough

To find me 
To find me

My love is not enough 
My love is not enough

To save me 
To save me 

You search through the forest and the bottomless sea
And you cry
Push the trees, push the sky, push the air aside

You look at their faces and their meaningless loss
And you cry
Who is she, who is she, who is she to say good bye?

Bye
