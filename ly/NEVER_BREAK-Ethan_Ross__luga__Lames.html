		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ayy, can't make no mistakes, what I sacrifice to wear these chains
You can't play this game, what I had to lose so I could gain
I'm too fast to chase, I can never break
I was never tame, that's how they all know my name (Yeah)

I walked into the function like, "Who 'bout to get punched tonight?"
I'm all up in the pit, ready to rip, I'ma go home with his bitch
I walked into the world like, "Do y'all wanna die tonight?"
Death written on her lips, give her a kiss, baby, I'm lovin' this bliss
Yеah, not alone, I'm with a team, all alone, I still gеt rich
Pretty people turn to fiends, beautiful souls gon' know what they worth
I just came to the scene, they gon' stare till they eyes hurt
Better tell me what you see (Yeah, yeah), if you hatin', better put in work
I know that they hate on me, uh-huh, but I'ma get the last laugh, ah-ha
Look at the way that I flex, I put this ice on my neck

Can't make no mistakes, what I sacrifice to wear these chains
You can't play this game, what I had to lose so I could gain
I'm too fast to chase, I can never break
I was never tame, that's (Okay, okay, like) how they all know my name

Bad bitch moshin' in the pit
Now back switch (Ayy), baby, who you with?
Yeah, she too fine, see the way she moves her hips
Now she all mine, now my songs in her playlist
Like, okay, gettin' to the money all day
Ridin' with the team always, RH gang
I don't want hoes, stay away
Take your face off like Dwayne
Bitch, I'ma rock, leave a ho left in shock
All of the women, they flock
I'm so bright, hittin' like McD' Sprite
See you in the pit all night, aight

Can't make no mistakes, what I sacrifice to wear these chains
You can't play this game, what I had to lose so I could gain
I'm too fast to chase, I can never break
I was never tame, that's how they all know my name
