		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on, baby
Let's do the twist
Come on, baby
Let's do the twist
Take me by my little hand
And go like this

E-yah, twist
Baby, baby, twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

My daddy is sleepin'
And mama ain't around
Yeah, daddy just sleepin'
And mama ain't around
We're gonna twisty, twisty, twisty
'Til we tear the house down

Come on and twist
Yeah, baby, twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist
E-yah

('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)

Yeah, you should see my little sis
You should see my, my little sis
She really knows how to rock
She knows how to twist

Come on and twist
Yeah, baby twist
Ooh yeah, just like this
Come on, little miss, and do the twist

('Round and 'round and 'round and 'round)
Yeah
That's all now
Yeah, twist all night
Twist
('Round and 'round and 'round)
