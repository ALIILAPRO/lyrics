		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg

Pulled up looking picture perfect, baby
High price, but I'm worth it, baby
Can't play with ya, I've been busy workin', baby
Gettin' faded in a European swervin' ay
Look, describe Iggy, groundbreaking what the word is
Hit the stage, yeah, shake it like I'm nervous
When in New York got me parking right on Madison
This ain't no accident, I'm killing them on purpose
I-G-G-Y, did she just have to do it baby
Ride with me, fly livin', there ain't nothin' to it
Now my waist slim, ass fat you gotta have it
Get my bake on, cake long
That's automatic

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

P-p-pussy power, pay me by the hour
I need me a Braveheart, can't deal with a coward
I tell him if he ain't ballin', he should hit the showers
If I peek and you lucky, baby, there's money hours
All yellow gold on me, like I'm Trinidad, James
Sittin' drop top wonderin' where the ceiling's at
I know my old thang wanna bring the feeling back
But I got a new thang, baby, I ain't feeling that
Iggy Iggy Iggy, can't you see?
That everybody wanna put their hands on me
See I be on this money why your man on me?
And I need another hand with all these bandz on me

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

Get up out my face like who' you think you are
Talking all this trash like blah-de-blah-de-blah
(Oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh)
Get up out my face like who'd you think you are
Make me wanna lay it like hi-di-hi-di-ha
(Oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh) na ha (oh eh oh)

I know you like the way I turn it on
I'm out here with my friends
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it
If you don't do this right, you're going home alone
I guess you'll have to beg
I'ma make you beg, I'ma make you beg for it

Oh boy, I'm like a drug
If you want my love better smoke it up
(Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it)
You can look, boy, but don't you touch
If you want my love make me give a fuck
(Make you beg for it, I'ma make you beg for it)
