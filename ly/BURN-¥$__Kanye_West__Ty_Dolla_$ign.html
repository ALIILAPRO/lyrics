		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her body like the wild, wild west
What if you don't bow down? Yeah
Ridin' in the wind, God bless
She's an inferno, it's a hell of a time

Burnin' like a candlelight
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is
Our love is
Burnin' like a candlelight (are you not entertained?)
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is (are you not entertained?)
Our love is

Who's not entertained by my pain?
Who ain't cash a check off my name?
When my campaign turned to canned pain
I burned eight billion to take off my chains
Burn, baby, burn
Sometimes it hurts, I guess I never learned
To who it may concern, the CEO of the firm
Is now somewhere smoking sherm with Big Worm
Man, a couple wrong turns
Could fry you forever, it's a permanent perm
You charging for cookie, that's bang for your buck
If you kissin' on the mouth, you ain't charging enough
You heard I was flyin' 'em out
They was tryin' for clout, I was dyin' of gout
Man, the world gone mad
Heard R. Kelly in the next Balenciaga ad

Burnin' like a candlelight (burn)
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is
Our love is
Burnin' like a candlelight
Your love is dangerous
Your love is, my love is
Our love is

Her body like the wild, wild west
What if you don't bow down? Yeah
Ridin' in the wind, God bless
She's an inferno, it's a hell of a time
