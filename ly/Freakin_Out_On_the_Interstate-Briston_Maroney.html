		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm freakin' out on the interstate
Rolling down the windows, baby, I can't hear a thing you say
I'm walking back to my favorite place
And I can feel them staring at me
Baby, do you think I'm doing something wrong?

And you got a lot on your mind
And your heart, it looks just like mine
There's no use in wasting your time anymore

I'm sorry I haven't been myself
And something's got me down
What it is, I cannot tell
I won't be satisfied with anything I've earned
Fear is just a part of love
And one thing I found
Is love is what you deserve

Driving home and call my father on the telephone
I hope you know I missed you, man
Let's put it all behind us if we can
Never feeling like I'm all the way home (all the way home)
Stones inside my raincoat pocket I gotta keep
Oh, won't you hold them for me?

And you got a lot on your mind
And your heart, it looks just like mine
There's no use in wasting your time anymore

I'm sorry I haven't been myself
And something's got me down
What it is, I cannot tell
I won't be satisfied with anything I've earned
Fear is just a part of love
And one thing I found
Is love is what you deserve

I'm sorry I haven't been myself
And something's got me down
What it is, I cannot tell
I won't be terrified with anything I've earned
Fear is just a part of love
And one thing I found
Is love is what you deserve
