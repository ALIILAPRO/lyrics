		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ayy, man, the-, the fuck you mean you ain't heard no fuckin')
Fuck am I doing? Gettin' this money

Goddamn, praise the Lord (whoa)
Bought land, conquistador
Madman, Don Draper drip
Nothing I can't afford
Big biz, I'm doing fine
Off to shenanigans
Tick-tick, my wrist won't die
I'm Robert Patekson

I'm getting bread, you crumbly
I got baguettes, you gettin' some fuglies
I'm getting cash, so kiss on my ass
And suck on my balls from front to the back, bitch
Mm-mm-mm-mm, she lovin' it
Penis is hard, my condom in love with me
Two thousand messages, all of them girls
Hand on the testament, buy her new pearls
No way, get my bag up, sell my kidney
Yes, I'm pamper, I ain't pissy
Watch my meat spin, make her dizzy
Need no reason, I ain't picky
I bought a house in Greece
I don't know why, I might have to lease it out
Gucci, you know it don't crease
Why did the beat cut out?

(Hey) turn that shit back up
(way) up her labia
(Paid) main stage India
(Say) ain't no way we up

Goddamn, praise the Lord (whoa)
Bought land, conquistador
Madman, Don Draper drip
Nothing I can't afford
Big biz, I'm doing fine
Off to shenanigans
Tick-tick, my wrist won't die
I'm Robert Patekson

I'm getting bagged in Baghdad
I'm stay reclined when I'm in the Maybach
Still getting cash, I'm getting giraffe
I rented a PJ, throwing some racks, I'm up in the sky
I cannot drive, insurance too high
I'm wipin' my ass, it's twenty-five ply
Up in the frame sending, I'ma go blind (on God)
And my car park only fit two
But I bought three, so I need more space
And everything you say, I've said before
You paraphrasing lil' bitch (uh, uh)

(Hey) turn that shit back up
(way) up her labia
(Paid) main stage India
(Say) ain't no way we up

Goddamn, praise the Lord (whoa)
Bought land, conquistador
Madman, Don Draper drip
Nothing I can't afford
Big biz, I'm doing fine
Off to shenanigans
Tick-tick, my wrist won't die
I'm Robert Patekson
Goddamn, praise the Lord (whoa)
Bought land, conquistador
Madman, Don Draper drip
Nothing I can't afford
Big biz, I'm doing fine
Off to shenanigans
Tick-tick, my wrist won't die
I'm Robert Patekson
