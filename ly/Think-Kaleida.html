		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go ahead, you're taking me down now
Give me, give me, give me, give me what you don't know
Go ahead, take me all out now
Get this, get this into your game

You got me in a heady drop
I never wanna come off
You got me with your beat-up bluff
I never wanna come up

Think of me, I'll never break your heart
Think of me, you're always in the dark
I am your light, your light, your light
Think of me, you're never in the dark

Now that I'm making this align
Let me, let me, let me, let me in the unknown

You got me in your open hand
I never wanna come back
A jooging that you never found
You know it's gonna come out

Think of me, I'll never break your heart
Think of me, you're always in the dark
I am your light, your light, your light
Think of me, you're never in the dark

Think of me, I'll never break your heart
Think of me, you're always in the dark
I am your light, your light, your light
Think of me, you're never in the dark
