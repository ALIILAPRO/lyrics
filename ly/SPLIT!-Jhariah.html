		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Savagery Intensity
I wish my brain would come and kill me
Stop what’s a kid to do
Lifting up her effervescence
Pleasant presence
Panicked pulse
Antidepressants
Acutely polarizing
I think it just might kill me split
Split
The things that she’s been through
Perpetuate her
All or nothing
Hating loving
Always something
Hard at trusting
So leave the blade behind
Recite the chorus line
Lying from beneath
Stimulate my every need
Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
The thoughts they all insist
The prescription is unfilled
Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
When my head begins to fall apart
I’ll kill my brain and trust my heart
Love’s a temperamental art
Don’t know where the hate starts
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
I haven’t had a thing to smile about
Since I was locked up and lucked
Out of having any hope of
Becoming not so hopeless
You’re all I’ve got in this eternal hell
You’re all that makes me well
You’re all that makes me well
You’re all that makes me, all that makes me
Hate the way I do when I’m with you
The only one who makes me
Feel such lament and despise
You ain't no friend of mine
A subtle change in time
Betrayal tastes like wine
So leave the blade behind
Recite the chorus line
Lying from beneath
Stimulate my every need
Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
The thoughts they all insist
The prescription is unfilled
Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
When my head begins to fall apart
I’ll kill my brain and trust my heart
Love’s a temperamental art
Don’t know where the hate starts
It’s just too much
It’s never enough
It’s just too much
It’s never enough
It’s just too much
It’s never enough
It’s just too much
It’s never enough
My sight’s divided once again
Who’s a foe and who’s a friend
Cut me open fix the lens
That makes me think I must defend
And if that is not enough
To make me who I want to be
Leave me here and let me be
Lying from beneath
Stimulate my every need
Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
The thoughts they all insist
The prescription is unfilled
Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
When my head begins to fall apart
I’ll kill my brain and trust my heart
Love’s a temperamental art
Don’t know where the hate starts
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
Love you hate you
