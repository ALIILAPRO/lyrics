		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nude's thoughts were interrupted by a knock at the door. The
postman muttered something about wishing he could go too
and handed over a yellow envelope.
It was a command long overdue that called for healthy,
young men.

In reply to your request,
please find...
I hereby protest.
To the ways and means you use
you know...
I cannot refuse.

So I'll take this vow
of Loyalty.
Fight for the right,
You have said,
To be free.

When this time has run its course,
I must...
Live without remorse.
For the deeds I'm bound to do,
I know...
it's all the same to you.

But I won't forget
the memory...
Taking a life,
for a life...
to be free.
