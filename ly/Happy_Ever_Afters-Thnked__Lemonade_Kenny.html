		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I look in your eyes, all I see is an empty heart
I wish I felt the same
I'm still holding on and it's making me go insane
Insane
Cause loving is never easy and we all know it
But this one stings like a knife and I can't ignore it
Cause when we lose someone, we lose a part of us
And when the night sets in, we only dream about
All the things that we could've been if we held on
But I guess happy ever afters don't exist
They don't exist
They don't exist
I saw you at the red light last night
Now I'm reminiscing who I was in the past life
I don't really know, why you went cold
We both know that we both had to pay the price
I know what the fast life feels like
Pushing down the pedal till I feel that I'll be fine
Some memories stay inside
So I'm tryna to see what's in sight
Head to my toes dressed up for the occasion
Waiting for you still in the location
If it gets real, I know we gon' make it
But wait, can you feel how my heart races
But baby, I'm one step closer
I notice you have your front door open
I walk in to see, were we meant to be
But eventually, it's getting clear to me
Cause when we lose someone, we lose a part of us
And when the night sets in, we only dream about
All the things that we could've been if we held on
But I guess happy ever afters don't exist
They don't exist
Cause when we lose someone, we lose a part of us
But I guess happy ever afters don't exist
They don't exist
