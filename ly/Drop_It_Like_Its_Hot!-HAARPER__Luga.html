		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gasoline down ya throat
Light da match, spark da floor
Take ya pick, who gon go? Immolate, geronimo

Watch it prance, watch it
Dance, watch da flash, my stance
Gettin ready for da army to advance
My land got da green, got
Da team, got da camp, my camp
Burn em high above da fire in trance
No chance

I'ma burn up their esophagus
Caught da hippopotamus hoarse in the river
Vocals coarse in da providence
Got em screaming pleadin for
Their savior the ominous
Holding on to meaning when I'm
Beaming at da populace

My money gettin greener my demeanor cleaner
Sweep em with da mop they drop

They drop they drop
They drop shootin them birds, make em
Bloody buckshots, shots, shots
Drop it like it's hot yuh

I just wanna kill off foes with da trigga
Plunge with da dao, now yo body in da river
Chop em like Kenpachi, cook em teriyaki
Got da upper hand, Magatama like Itachi

Watch it prance, watch it
Dance, watch da flash, my stance
Gettin ready for da army to advance
My land got da green, got
Da team, got da camp, my camp
Burn em high above da fire in trance
No chance

Crack a collar bone
Snap with da bass right at yo dome
BFG shattering ya team
Gonna clean like listerine
The dirt the mess, fuck all the rest
My collar clean, rupture their nest
I dip with Anna on my chest
Gyp da crest and never less

My money gettin greener my demeanor cleaner
Sweep em with da mop they drop

They drop they drop
They drop shootin them birds, make em
Bloody buckshots, shots, shots
Drop it like it's hot yuh
