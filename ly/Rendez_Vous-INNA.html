		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Met you in the water, oh, oh
Swimmin' in the shallow of my heart
Went a little deeper, oh, oh
I knew that we were perfect from the start

Oh baby, me and you
We're gonna have a little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it a ménage à deux
The way you loved me, gave me déjà vu

When I get the feelin', real in the summer
You can come and meet me, we can fall in love
Take me to the sea, take me to the sun
Just a little secret, no one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

Temperature is risin', oh, oh
You're the only one to cool me down
You're my hidden treasure on the shore
You know, you're the best thing that I've found

Oh baby, me and you
We're gonna have a little rendez vous
We're gonna keep it a ménage à deux
The way you loved me, gave me déjà vu

When I get the feelin' real in the summer
You can come and meet me, we can fall in love
Take me to the sea, take me to the sun
Just a little secret, no one needs to know

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

I hear your body
I hear it callin'
I move to the rhythm of you
'Cause you know exactly what to do

Oh, rendez vous
Oh, rendez vous

When I get the feelin'
When I get the feelin'
When I get the feelin'
When I get the feelin'
No one needs to know
Oh, rendez vous
