		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You doing that thing you do
Breaking my heart into a million pieces 
Like you always do
And you don't mean to be cruel
You never even knew about the heartache
I've been going through

Well, I try and try to forget you girl
But it's just so hard to do
Every time you do that thing you do
I know all the games you play
And I'm gonna find a way
To let you know that you'll be mine someday

'Cause we could be happy can't you see?
If you'd only let me be
The one to hold you and keep you here with me

'Cause I try and try to forget you girl
But it's just so hard to do

Every time you do that thing you do
I don't ask a lot girl (I don't ask a lot girl)
But I know one things for sure (know one things for sure)
It's love I haven't got girl
And I just can't take it anymore, ow

'Cause we could be happy, can't you see?
If you'd only let me be
The one to hold you and keep you here with me

'Cause it hurts me so Just to see you go
Around with someone new

And if I know you you're doing that thing
Every day just doing that thing
I can't take you do that thing you do
