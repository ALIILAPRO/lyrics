I just came to my senses (yeah)
I stay in another dimension
Fear is non-existent
Suit up and swing through the city (ooh, hey)
Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (afraid)
I'm in my own world, give me space
I'm in my own universe, give me space (yeah)

Weezy Carter, I'm 'bout to go Peter Parker
I'm Spider-Man, if he ain't me, he just a creepy crawler
Tunechi spark the lighter, pull up in a new Ferrari spider
Spider web necklace with the diamonds
She'll turn to Spider-Woman if I bite her
I will not go back and forth with you
I see you got the black widow with you
You should've had a black hero with you
I get an opp-arachnophobia
I've been litty since I flicked the lighter
Since I was an itsy bitsy spider
They've been tryna wash the spider out
I got spiders crawlin' out your mouth, Spider-Verse

I just came to my senses (yeah)
I stay in another dimension
Fear is non-existent
Suit up and swing through the city (ooh, hey)
Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (afraid)
I'm in my own world, give me space
I'm in my own universe, give me space (yeah)

I'm focused, I'm focused (focused)
I'm chosen, I'm golden (golden)
I'm stronger, on missions, ain't no foldin', a soldier (soldier)
My vision persistent, I took the game, it's over (it's over)
I made a name, it's global (it's global), my enemy pass over (hey)
I took the way to the top, I had to learn to be smart (smart)
I had to move with my heart, keepin' my eyes on the part
'Cause it get evil and dark (evil and dark)
When it come to my opponents
I know how to beat 'em, I know to defeat 'em (hey)
Livin' my life by the moment
Somebody callin', somebody gon' need 'em

I just came to my senses (yeah)
I stay in another dimension
Fear is non-existent
Suit up and swing through the city (ooh, hey)
Annihilate, I'm wide awake, be very afraid (afraid)
I'm in my own world, give me space
I'm in my own universe, give me space (space)

Okay, we bounce and shake, we roll and rock
I gotta set it straight, the block is hot
Something's come over me, I hit unlock
And tell my enemies, "I'll never stop"
No, no, nothing can shake me now
Tell the block I made it now
Yeah, the whole town is talking now
I swear, nothing can stop me now
All this, boosting all my senses
I won't start, but I finished
I shoot my shot, bet I won't miss it
Only way to go is go the distance
Nothing can shake me now
Nothing can break me down
Tell the whole town, we popping now
Nothing can shake me now

M.W.A. Music
This is unbelievable
(This is the lobby)
Oh
(Welcome to Spider Society)
