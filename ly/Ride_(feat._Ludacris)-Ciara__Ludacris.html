Uh-huh

Catch me in the mall
You know I buy it out
G5 planes, yeah I fly it out
On the back look like 'Lac sittin' on 28s
Oh you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL Georgia
Booties look like this size
23 waist, pretty face, thick thighs 

I can do it big
I can do it long
I can do whenever or however
You want

I can do it up and down
I can do circles
To him I'm a gymnast
This room is my circus

I market it so good
They can't wait 'til you try me
I work it so good
Man, these 
Tryna buy I I I I me

They love the way I ride it ('cause I do it good)
They love the way I ride it ('cause it feels so good, yeah)
They love the way I ride it ('cause I do it good)
They love the way I ride the beat
How I ride the beat
I ride it, they love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride it
They love the way I ride the beat
Like I'm a freak freak freak, uh

And I won't stop, don't stop, get it, get it
I'ma pitch it down the middle baby, hit it, hit it
I do it to him right, it's mmh-mmh good
Handle my business like a big girl should
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4
5 o'clock, 6 o'clock, baby give me more
Pick me up, pick me up, you are my Ducati
All up on your frame, baby say my name
Show you how to get 'em, show you how to do it
Left hip, right hip, put your back into it

I market it so good, they can't wait to try-uh-uh-uh-uy me
I work it so good, man these tryna buy-uh-uh-uh-uy me

He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it (I love the way you ride the beat baby)
He love the way I ride the beat (I love it)
Like a freak freak freak, uh

Luda!
She ride it like a roller coaster
Soon as I get her to the top, she screams
I put her out like a light
She'll be out for the night
Soon as I hit, her head hit the pillow, sweet dreams
Wake her up 'bout thirty minutes later
Calling me to tell me later, "Let's go again"
Red zone, I'ma get her first down, call me Luda Drew Brees, I throw it in
Touchdown, he scores, Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that, Cici, better see-see me
'Cause them legs just keep on going, so I gotta put her to bed
Let the 808 thump and the beat go bump 'cause she ride it like a thoroughbred

He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride the beat 
Like I'm a freak freak freak, uh

(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby baby baby
Do you like it up, when I'm up
When I'm down, when I'm down?
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby baby baby
He can't stand to look away while I'm whirlin' this around
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby baby
You like it, when I take it up and down
(Ooh ooh ooh) oh baby
He love it when I twirl this thing all around

He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride it
He love the way I ride the beat
Like I'm a freak freak freak, uh

Catch me in the mall, you know I buy it out
G5 plane, yeah I fly it out
On the back look like 'Lac sittin' on 28s
No you can't get her if you ain't got plenty cake
ATL, Georgia, booties look like this size
23 waist, pretty face, thick thighs
