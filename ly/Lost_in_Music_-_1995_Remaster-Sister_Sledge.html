		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my nine to five
We're lost in music

Have you ever seen some people lose everything
First to go is their mind
Responsibility to me is a tragedy
I'll get a job some other time, uh-huh

I want to join a band and play in front of crazy fans
Yes, I call that temptation
Give me the melody that's all that I ever need
The music is my salvation

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap
No turnin' back
We're lost in music

We're lost in music
Feel so alive
I quit my nine to five
We're lost in music

Mmm, hmm, in the spotlight the band plays so very tight
Each and every night, uh-huh
It's not vanity to me, it's my sanity
I could never survive

Some people ask me "What are you gonna be?
Why don't you go get a job?" uh-uh
All that I could say "I won't give up my music"
Not me, not now, no way, no how, oh

We're lost in music
Caught in a trap (Caught up in our music)
No turnin' back (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
We're lost in music

We're lost in music (Don't take our away our music)
Feel so alive (Feel)
I quit (I quit) my nine to five (Yeah)
We're lost in music

We're lost in music (Melody is good to me)
Caught in a trap (I'm caught up in it)
No turnin' back (No, no, no)
We're lost in music (Ooh, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)

We're lost in music (Da la la la la, da da da la la)
Feel so alive
