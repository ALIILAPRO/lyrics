		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said, "Hallelujah"
Good God, girl, I wish I knew ya

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
Well, I know, I know it's you
You say, "Hello" and then I say, "I do"

Come back, baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Livin' in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside, Mike Johnson
Yes, I could, in the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake, it's a lake, she's kissin' me
As they do when they do in Sicily

I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
Well, I know, I know it's you
You say, "Hello" and then I say, "I do"

Where you wanna go? Who you wanna be?
What you wanna do? Just come with me
Oh, I saw God and I saw the fountains
You and me, girl, sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me, oh my, oh, me and Guy O
Freer than a bird 'cause we're rockin' Ohio
Around the world, I feel dutiful
Take a wife 'cause life is beautiful

I know, I know for sure
Ding, dang, dong, dong, ding, ding, dong, dong, ding, dang
Well, I know, I know it's you
Ding, dang, dong, dong, ding, ding, dong, dong, ding, dang
Mother Russia, do not suffer, I know you're bold enough
I've been around the world and I have seen your love
Well, I know, I know it's you
You say, "Hello" and then I say, "I do"
