		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I stand in line
Until you think you have the time
To spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance
I know that there's a chance
You won't be leaving with me

Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
And have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"
I can see it in your eyes
You still despise the same old lies
You heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you
For me it's true
And never seemed so right before

I practice every day
To find some clever lines to say
To make the meaning come through
But then I think I'll wait
Until the evening gets late
And I'm alone with you

The time is right, your perfume fills my head
The stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

The time is right, your perfume fills my head
The stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all
By saying somethin' stupid like, "I love you"

"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
"I love you"
