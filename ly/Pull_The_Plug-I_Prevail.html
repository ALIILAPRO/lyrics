		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody wake me up

Breathe in and breathe out, that's what I tell myself
When the voices inside say that I won't survive
When did I become so cold and so numb?
To the hope in my mind, to the fire drowning inside

Wake me up, I'm seconds from the end
I'm dying to feel, I've been dying to live
Will somebody give me a sign, so I know I'm alive?
It's time to wake me up, or pull the plug

Somebody wake me up

Am I better off dead, is it all in my head?
There's a snake in my mind, spitting venom and lies
It runs through my veins, paralyzed by the pain
I'm at the end of my rope, as it's placed around my throat

Wake me up, I'm seconds from the end
I'm dying to feel, I've been dying to live
Will somebody give me a sign, so I know I'm alive?
It's time to wake me up, or pull the plug

I can't wake up

I've been screaming but no words come out
You can't hear me, it's just silence now
Trapped in a nightmare with my eyes sewn shut
Is this what I've become? Somebody...

Wake me up, I'm seconds from the end
I'm dying to feel, I've been dying to live
Will somebody give me a sign, so I know I'm alive?
It's time to wake me up, or pull the plug

Pull the plug
Somebody wake me up
