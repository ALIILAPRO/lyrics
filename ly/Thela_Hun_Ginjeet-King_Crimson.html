		  Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Qua tari mei, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Qua tari mei, heat in the jungle streets

Well, first of all
I couldn't even see his face
I couldn't see his face
He was holding a gun in his hand
Umm, I was thinking
This is a dangerous place
This is a dangerous place

Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Qua tari mei, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Qua tari mei, heat in the jungle streets

I said, "I'm nervous as hell from this stuff"
Those guys were going to kill me for sure
They ganged up on me like that
I couldn't believe it
I mean look, I'm still shakin'
Weird
They're out in the streets like that
It's a dangerous place
It's a dangerous place

So, suddenly, these two guys appear in front of me
They stopped
Real aggressive
Start at me, you know
"What's that?" "What's that on that tape?"
"What do you got there?"
I said, "huh?"
They said, "What are you talking into that for?"
I said, "It's just a tape, you know"
"Well play it for me"
I said "oh, no"
I put it off as long as I could
And finally they turned it on, you know
They grabbed it from me
Took it away from me
Turned it on
And it said, "He held a gun in his hand. This is a dangerous place."
They said, "What dangerous place?" "What gun?" "You're a policeman!"
And the deeper I talked, the worse I got into it
I talked, I told him, I said, "Look man, I'm not talkin'"
It went on forever
Anyway, I finally unbuttoned my shirt, and said,
"Look, look, I'm in this band, you know, I'm in this band you know,
And we're makin' a recording, you know
It's just about New York City, it's about crime in the streets"
The explanation was going nowhere, but
Finally, they just kinda let me go, I don't know why
So I walk around the corner
And I'm like shakin' like a leaf
And I thought, "This is a dangerous place"

Who should appear, but two policeman

Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
Thela Hun Ginjeet, Thela Hun Ginjeet
