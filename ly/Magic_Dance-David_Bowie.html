		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You remind me of the babe (what babe?)
The babe with the power (what power?)
The power of voodoo (who do?)
You do (do what?)
Remind me of the babe

I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry
What could I do? 
My baby's love had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

What kind of magic spell to use
Slime and snails?
Or puppy dog tails? 
Thunder or lightning?
Then baby said

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Put that baby's spell on me
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby, make him free

I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try
What could I do? 
My baby's fun had gone
And left my baby blue
Nobody knew

What kind of magic spell to use
Slime and snails?
Puppy dogs' tails
Thunder or lightning?
Then baby said

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) 
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) 
Put that baby's spell on me (ooh)
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) 
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) 
Put that magic jump on me (ooh)
Slap that baby, make him free

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) 
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) 
Put that baby's spell on me

You remind me of the babe (what babe?)
The babe with the power (what power?)
The power of voodoo (who do?)
You do (do what?)
Remind me of the babe

Dance magic, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh
Dance magic

What kind of magic spell to use?
Slime and snails?
Or puppy dog tails?
Thunder or lightning?
Something frightening?

Dance magic, dance
Dance magic, dance
Put that baby spell on me

Jump magic, jump
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby, make him free

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)

Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)
Jump magic, jump
Put that magic jump on me
Slap that baby
Slap that, slap that baby, make him free

Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)
