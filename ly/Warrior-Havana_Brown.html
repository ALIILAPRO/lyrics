		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a fighter, eh eh, it's in my DNA
Step by step, and brick by brick, nobody stopping me
Quit trying to shoot me down, 'cause I'm invincible
I think you made a mistake, I am a warrior

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel my blood running wild and young
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior

Warrior
Warrior
Warrior
Warrior

I am a blizzard, eh eh, so don't get in my way
I keep on blowing 'til there's nothing left in front of me
You wanna take my crown, but I'm invincible
You are a venomous snake, but I'm a warrior

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel my blood running wild and young
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior

Warrior
Warrior
Warrior
Warrior

People can say what they wanna say
When I'm in the ring, baby, I'm heavy-weight
I'm not gonna run when I hear them call, hear them call

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion

I'm gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel my blood running wild and young
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior

Warrior
Warrior
Warrior
Warrior
