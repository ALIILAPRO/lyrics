		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take your shot for the lovers of a generation
Honey every little thing you do is a ghost of your imagination 

And don't tell the groom that we all find him such a dirty mess
Scare him straight and tear apart his head below his favorite moon

All your fault and it's such a funny revelation that you're lonely in a crowded room

When it should have been a celebration 
Late for excuses!

I walk in and tell you that your dead
Cross my heart and bury you in lead
Below a lasso'd moon

Ransoms and phantoms won't save you tonight
 
Tell me why?
Why'd you call me again?
Why'd you leave me for dead?
Why'd you take your revenge?
Oh darling

Don't look back and live a happy-ever-after
With dirt caked in your nails
And the screams of your surrender become a distant squeal 

My heart is black and beating in a jail
Hell is scary and hell is real
My love, I wish we knew

Ransoms and phantoms won't save you tonight
 
Tell me why?
Why'd you call me again?
Why'd you leave me for dead?
Why'd you take your revenge?
Oh darling

Can you feel it?

Why?
Why'd you call me again?
Why'd you leave me for dead?
Why'd you take your revenge?
Oh tell me!
