		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My relations with the man above lately
In-decisions have been breaking my sanity
Contamination of a twisted society
Retaliation when I'm full of anxiety

And I was born to be anything I wanted to be
Raised to be fucking mean
I'm a masterpiece
Blasphemy, meet again in a world so vicious
Children crying, mothers scream, fathers drink
All you bastards scream
All you bastards scream
All you bastards scream

A Band-Aid on a bullet hole that's still bleeding
Numb you up until you can't feel a goddamn thing
A generation full of anti-sobriety
A generation that is full of anxiety
(Full of anxiety)
(Full of anxie')

And I was born to be anything I wanted to be
Raised to be fucking mean
I'm a masterpiece
Blasphemy, meet again in a world so vicious
Children crying, mothers scream, fathers drink
All you bastards scream
All you bastards scream
All you bastards scream

Remember all the voices in your head that keep talking
All the blood on your skin that keeps crawling
All the voices in your head that keep talking
All the blood on your skin that keeps crawling
All the voices in your head that keep talking
All the blood on your skin that keeps crawling
All the voices in your head that keep talking
And all the blood on your skin that keeps crawling

I was born to be anything I wanted to be
Raised to be fucking mean
I'm a masterpiece
Blasphemy, meet again in a world so vicious
Children crying, mothers scream, fathers drink
All you bastards scream
All you bastards scream
All you bastards scream
