		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream another nightmare
I'm in love with all these ghosts
Stumble up a flight of stairs
Wake up all alone
Mixin' up my words now
Don't leave me high and dry
'Cause I'm mixin' up prescriptions
I don't wanna lose my life

I'm afraid that misery 
Might take me backwards
I'm afraid my misery
Might bring you down

It's 'cause I don't love me anymore
I kill myself everyday a little more
And I need you now like I needed you then
I don't love me, so I can't love you in the end
I don't love you anymore
I lose myself everyday a little more
And I don't need you now like I needed you then
I don't love me, so I can't love you in the end

I wish that I was someone else
Different face and different home
'Cause I'm cleanin' out my closet
Afraid of what I'll find below
Now I'm tryin' to remember
What it felt like to hold you
You said, "Why you let yourself down?"
"Why do these demons control you?"

I'm afraid that misery 
Might take me backwards
I'm afraid my misery
Might bring you down

It's 'cause I don't love me anymore
I kill myself everyday a little more
And I need you now like I needed you then
I don't love me, so I can't love you in the end
I don't love you anymore
I lose myself everyday a little more
And I don't need you now like I needed you then
I don't love me, so I can't love you in the end

In the end
In the end
I don't love me
I can't love you
I don't love me
I can't love you
