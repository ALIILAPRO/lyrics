		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The mystery of mankind
A journey with a destination unknown
A search for what cannot be found
The expedition of eternity

The mystery of mankind
Where is the c*****is?

Is it next to the nipple?
Is it behind the knee?
Is it inside of the uterus?
Or is it like actually on top of the uterus?
Is it in your best friend Stacy? 
Because I checked there and couldn't find it and then you got all mad about it
But maybe you were on your period and being hormonal or something

The mystery of m--
The mystery of--
Just let me say the thing
The mys--
For f***'s sake
Oh my god just play the f*****g song

Can girls o****m too? (Uh)

Wait keep doing that
Just like that
Oh my god you actually found it

Keep going, right there
Oh my god yes

Choke me daddy, don't stop
Wait
Wait, did you seriously finish already?
