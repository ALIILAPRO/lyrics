		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It gave us a purpose, sometimes
It gave us a reason, and a rhyme
Looking for meaning in song
Such inner searching, so long
So long

But we laughed
And we cried
And we fought
And we tried
And we failed

But I loved you
I loved you

Building foundations, straining
Such good intentions, failing
Slowly we faltered from the line
Slowly dissolving our time
Our time

But we laughed
And we cried
And we fought
And we tried
And we failed

But I loved you
I loved you
