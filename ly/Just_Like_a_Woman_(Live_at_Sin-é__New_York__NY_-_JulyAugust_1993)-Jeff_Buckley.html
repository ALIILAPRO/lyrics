		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman
Yes, as she makes love just like a woman
Oh, and she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she sees finally that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls

She takes 
Just like a woman, yes, she does
And she makes love just like a woman
Yes she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

But it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse is this pain in here
I can't stay in here, oh baby, ain't it clear that

I just can't fit
I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don't you let on that you knew me
When I was hungry and it was your world

Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
And you make love just like a woman
And then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
She breaks just like a little girl
