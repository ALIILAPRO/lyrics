		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Following a feeling
Got no reason I should show up here tonight
Here tonight
And I'm hoping for a signal
But I'll settle for your body in my mind
In my mind

Starts as innocent but moves so quickly, so quickly
Yeah, when you look at me I must be dreaming

Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The room keeps shaking
Put your arms around me
And the walls start breaking
Tell me that you found me
And my world starts changing
I see it all in my mind
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The floor keeps spinning
Whisper in my ear
That I'm the one you need and
Touch me like I've never
Even felt this feeling
Baby, I wish you were mine
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why

Started as a fantasy
But I found it so hard to push it down
Push it down
How at any given moment
I would say your name so I could hear the sound
Hear the sound

Starts as innocent but moves so quickly, so quickly
Yeah, when you look at me I must be dreaming

Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The room keeps shaking
Put your arms around me
And the walls start breaking
Tell me that you found me
And my world starts changing
I see it all in my mind
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The floor keeps spinning
Whisper in my ear
That I'm the one you need and
Touch me like I've never
Even felt this feeling
Baby, I wish you were mine
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why

Starts as innocent but moves so quickly, so quickly
Yeah, when you look at me I must be dreaming

Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The room keeps shaking
Put your arms around me
And the walls start breaking
Tell me that you found me
And my world starts changing
I see it all in my mind
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
The floor keeps spinning
Whisper in my ear
That I'm the one you need and
Touch me like I've never
Even felt this feeling
Baby, I wish you were mine
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why

Oh, I don't know, I don't know
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
Oh, I don't know, I don't know
Oh, I don't know why, no, I don't know why
