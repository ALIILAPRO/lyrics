		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you heard about
What you heard about
What you heard about me?
P.I.M.P

What you heard about
What you heard about
What you heard about me?
P.I.M.P

What you heard about
What you heard about
What you heard about me?
P.I.M.P

What you heard about
What you heard about
What you heard about me?
P.I.M.P

Now, shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thang for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies
They pay her, 'cause they want her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P.I.M.P

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P.I.M.P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P.I.M.P

P.I.M.P
Motherfuckin' P.I.M.P
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P.I.M.P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P.I.M.P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P.I.M.P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P.I.M.P

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P.I.M.P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P.I.M.P

P.I.M.P
Motherfuckin' P.I.M.P
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P.I.M.P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P.I.M.P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P.I.M.P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P.I.M.P
