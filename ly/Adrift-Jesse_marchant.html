		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tied to what is late, ain't you now
Adrift, I know all I was is gone
Still life underwater, cheap shot
Blown out too far away
To become right
In moonlight on a wandering field
I drank alone and watched
It come unreeled
A life to belong to and keep
In straight line
Blown now too far away
To be done right

I wish you'd hide the way you feel

Gun blasts get fired away
Straight lines defined in the waves
Stranded and effaced in the black
Old lives bleeding naked
And last forms of other lines
Of the chase
Ghosts of denial and fame
Gone now
Well they will find you again
Gone now
Well they will find you again
Coming at you
When you're finding your way
Coming at you
When you're fine and eat away

Tied to what is late, ain't you now
