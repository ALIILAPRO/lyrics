		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sold myself on paradise
But I'm giving up on that ghost
'Cause it keeps me from counting the cost
Moments I've loved and I've lost
Bow down to the splits in the seconds

Did I suffer on? Were the nights too long?
All the echoes are so miscalculated
When I'm dead and gone, and the race is won
Will everything be less complicated?

I give you my word
In the times I've had enough
I still wish for the worst
As free as a bird
But the days keep crossing off
Heaven came with a curse

I'm frozen here, I'm paralyzed
Would you pull it outta my throat?
'Cause I'm tired of burning these boats
Praying to God that I float
Bow down to the splits in the seconds

I give you my word
In the times I've had enough
I still wish for the worst
As free as a bird
But the days keep crossing off
Heaven came with a curse

I won't pretend to know my end
The credits roll, I'm afraid it's
The end of the earth
'Cause the days keep crossing off
(Heaven came with a curse)

You give me a conscience, I'll give you a crisis
Hard times but I'd rather see this than be blinded
Breakdown what's behind us
Darkness only cares what the light does

I give you my word
In the times I've had enough
I still wish for the worst
As free as a bird
But the days keep crossing off
Heaven came with a curse

I give you my word
In the times I've had enough
I still wish for the worst
As free as a bird
But the days keep crossing off
Heaven came with a curse

I won't pretend to know my end
The credits roll, I'm afraid it's
The end of the earth
'Cause the days keep crossing off
(Heaven came with a curse)

Heaven came with a curse
