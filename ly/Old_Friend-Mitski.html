		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if

You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby

I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee, talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you want to give me, baby
