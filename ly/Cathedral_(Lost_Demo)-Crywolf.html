		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With the lights turned down
And the stars all out of line
I'm hoping you could draw me close to you
Draw me close to you
I can tell you're falling
I can tell you're out of time
You're hoping I could make you feel
The way I felt that night

I can't remember your name
Feel you evaporating
Your memory starting to fade
Slowly incinerating
Give me your heart on a plate
I'll show you to the water
I'll watch you drifting away

You thought I was the one
You thought that I could give
You what you need i'm fading with the sun
And all the while you're burning in the east
