		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tentative captain
Don't keep your eyes on the ground
Heaven's been offered
Leaving this earth is such a beautiful sound
I'm safe when I feel I don't feels not around
So I'm leaving tomorrow 

Hesitant captain
It's too late to turn back around
The party is waiting 
And leaving this earth is such a beautiful sound
I feel when I feel I don't feels not around

So I'm leaving tomorrow 

Don't cry for me I'm the talk of the town
And don't worry mother 
I blow kisses to you while the sun's going down 
Tell dad I'm alright and I'll see him around 
Maybe tomorrow...
