		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me your hand 
The dog in the garden row is covered in mud 
And dragging your mother's clothes 
Cinder and smoke 
The snake in the basement 
Found the juniper shade 
The farmhouse is burning down 

Give me your hand 
And take what you will tonight, I'll give it as fast 
And high as the flame will rise 
Cinder and smoke 
Some whispers around the trees 
The juniper bends 
As if you were listening 

Give me your hand 
Your mother is drunk as all the firemen shake
A photo from father's arms 
Cinder and smoke 
You'll ask me to pray for rain 
With ash in your mouth 
You'll ask it to burn again
