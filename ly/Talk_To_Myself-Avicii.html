		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone I'm searching for devotion
In a faded melody
My soul is trying to cross an ocean
Down on bended knee
Lock up my cadence and rhyme
Don't know what I'm tryin' to say, yeh
My heart, all the time was stolen by bad poetry

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me

I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open
Love's insanity
So long, words are left unspoken
Couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
My heart, I'm left with a broken 
Vocabulary 

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words that I could say to no one else
Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me

Some nights I talk to myself
I said the words that I could say to no one else (some nights)
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I said the words I never said when you were with me
