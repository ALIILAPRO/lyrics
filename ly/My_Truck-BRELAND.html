		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can drink my liquor
You can call my lady
You can take my money
You can smoke my blunt
Scuff these Jordans
You can say you hate me
You can call me crazy, but
Don't touch my truck (skrrt, skrrt)
Skrrt (yeah, yeah)
Skrrt
Don't touch my truck (brrp, yeah)
Skrrt (woo-oh)
Skrrt
Don't touch my

V8 engine with the windows tinted
Boy, we came from the bottom, got it out the mud
Whole block jumpin' 'cause the subs stay hittin'
If they roll up on me, know I keep one tucked (ooh, yeah)

Woo
Tell them boys come and get me
I be ridin' through the city
Young, rich and I'm pretty
Homie, don't get it twisted 
Keep a semi in the hemi (oh)
Red cup full of Henny
My hitters come in plenties, for real

You can drink my liquor
You can call my lady
You can take my money
You can smoke my blunt
Scuff these Jordans
You can say you hate me
You can call me crazy, but
Don't touch my truck (skrrt, skrrt)
Skrrt (yeah, yeah)
Skrrt
Don't touch my truck (brrp, yeah)
Skrrt (woo-oh)
Skrrt
Don't touch my

Wood grain dash with the matte black finish
And it match my shawty with the big ol' butt
Know them boys soft 'cause they got hard feelings
You can try me if you wanna go and test your luck (woo)

Tell them boys come and get me (get me)
I be ridin' through the city
Young, rich and I'm pretty (yeah)
Homie, don't get it twisted (yeah)
Keep a semi in the hemi (in the hemi)
Red cup full of Henny (yeah, we drinking)
My hitters come in plenties, for real

You can drink my liquor
You can call my lady
You can take my money
You can smoke my blunt
Scuff these Jordans
You can say you hate me
You can call me crazy, but
Don't touch my truck 
Skrrt
Skrrt
Don't touch my truck 
Skrrt 
Skrrt
Don't touch my

Woo, ooh, woo, ooh, woo, ooh
Don't touch my truck (woo, ooh)
Don't touch my truck
