		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
I even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
And when my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And I've given all my love

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do
