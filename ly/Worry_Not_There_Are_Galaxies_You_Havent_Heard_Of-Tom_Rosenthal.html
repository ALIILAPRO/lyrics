		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "What d'you wanna be when you grow up?"
Oh, the empty cry for certainty
They want to know what you want to be
But why have I got to be something?
Oh, aren't we all dumplings?
Take a minute, wallow in it, float around
Give it all a second glance or three
Today is its own entity
And you are its beautiful painter
And you still will be later

So worry not, there are galaxies
You have not heard of
There are eyes you have not seen shine
And there are so many people
Waiting to love you
It just takes time

What d'you wanna be when you grow up?
Maybe eighty and still pondering
The merits of this questioning
And how there are zero good answers
For all the mess before us

So worry not, there are galaxies
You have not heard of
There are eyes you have not seen shine
There are so many people
Waiting to love you
It just takes time

Five-year plans, the dead exams
The worry born
Oh, the bucket list will tick you off
They say now is not soon enough
Oh, how they have got you running so fast
You can't see what you fly past
What d'you wanna be when you grow up?
Life is far too short to ever know
And long enough to let it blow
Away on the wind to wherever
Let's watch it go together

So worry not, there are galaxies
You have not heard of
There are eyes you have not seen shine
There are so many people
Waiting to love you
It just takes time
It just takes time
It just takes time
It just takes time
