		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As we talk the golden mile
Down the pretty aisle
I know that you are mine
And there's nothing in this world

That I know that I won't do
To be near you everyday
Every hour every minute
Take my hand and let me lead the way

All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part
I'll be your friend

My love will never end
Till death do us part
When I wake up everyday
With you lying in my arms

I wonder if I'm dreaming
When I look into your eyes
I just can't believe it's true
That my heart belongs to you

Baby you can have it all
Take my hand and let me lead the way
All through your life
I'll be by your side

Till death do us part
I'll be your friend
My love will never end
Till death do us part

There'll be good times
And there'll be bad
But I will stand beside you woman
All the way

And through the years
As life goes on Ã…?n' on
When snow will fall on winter nights
I'll keep you warm inside

Yeah baby I will
All through your life
I'll be by your side
Till death do us part

I'll be your friend
My love will never end
Till death do us part
