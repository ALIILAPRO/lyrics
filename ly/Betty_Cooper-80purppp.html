		<p>
		  Yeah
Ay
Yeah
Ay
This has been a trend from the start right
I thought you knew that I was gona break your heart right
You were a troop but now you gona bare the scares like wow
Love equals hate now wow
I just wona say I know
Speaking from the shit I wrote
Why you gotta leave I quote
Bitch I wona talk like wow
Fuck I’m tryna save your soul
Fuck I'm tryna save your soul
This is what happens when they be laughing
Fuck I’m getting pissed cuz like damn I'm always reacting
Why you acting like me and you weren't supposed to happen
Acting like we weren't ever happy why is u capping
Honestly didn't think it through
before I found something fucking new
I wish we could hold it down for you
I just wona hold it down for you
This was not what it was meant to be
This was a tragedy
But you were bad for me
Got way to sad for me
So I just left
So please don’t be mad at me
Please don't be mad at me
Misinterpreted
Loosing my mind and I’m loosing my patients
Didn’t know one day you’d become the patient
I’m just saying
Contemplating
Shits frustrating
Feeling like I gotta get it
And I been hating on you because I can’t forget it
And ima focus on you until you can respect it
So we can go a be friends and really try replenish
Made a goal to myself to really try and mend it
Misinterpreted

Misinterpreted
Easily Misinterpreted
Misinterpreted
Yeah
