		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have been in love and been alone
I have traveled over many miles to find a home
There's that little place inside of me
That I never thought could take control of everything
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night (alive)
Even though she's not real it's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night (alive)
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

I've so many things I want to say
I'll be ready when the perfect moment comes my way
I had never known what's right for me
'Till the night she opened up my heart and set it free
But now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night (alive)
Even though she's not real it's all right
'Cause I only feel alive when I dream at night (alive)
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

Now I just spend all my time with anyone
Who makes me feel the way she does

'Cause I only feel alive (only feel alive)
When I dream at night (when you're by my side)
Even though she's not real it's all right
(That's all right baby, that's all right baby)
'Cause I only feel alive (alive) (oh-oh-oh)
When I dream at night (alive)
Even though she's not real it's all right (oh when I'm by your side)
