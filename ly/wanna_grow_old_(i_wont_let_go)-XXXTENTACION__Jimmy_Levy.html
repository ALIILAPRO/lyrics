		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let
I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let, I won't let

Now I put the blade down, darling
I wanna see the light of the mornin'
I was stuck inside of yesterdays
Sedative ease the pain on my wrist
I put the blade down, darling, oh
I stood in the dark wishin' the end was near
Now I found my heart, and I know I have worth here

So I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let
I won't let
I won't let go, oh
Don't wanna grow old, old
I won't let go, oh
I won't let
I won't let
