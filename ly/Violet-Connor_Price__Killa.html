		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling so tall, I could give a high five to the pilot
Yeah, family tight, I keep small circle like eyelet
Whoa, inbox full of contracts I sign with a stylus
Yeah, blue faces blowing up like Violet

Talk about the things they gonna say when they see me
And when they see me, they just dap me up and say good to meet me
I keep it going flowing over this I make it look easy
Easy for me to say I do this every day of the week
I'm eager to be the one they talk about when all said and done with it
I'm the feature that they want, but then they don't when I come with it
I'm a scene stealer, seat filler, blow up the numbers
And I ain't leaving no crumbs so you know when I'm done with it

I'm a new school vibe with a old soul
Oh so great, stay paid by the boat load
Don't go chasing the wave I'm a row boat
Blow smoke right through the face of the ozone
Oh no
I got the bag, I'm back to just double it
I'm bout to pop the top, I been bubblin'
They want the spot but I do not cut 'em in
They trying to plot my drop, they been huddling

Ah, feeling so tall I could give a high five to the pilot
Yeah, family tight, I keep small circle like eyelet
Whoa, inbox full of contracts I sign with a stylus (Killa)
Yeah, blue faces blowing up like Violet

Yo, I know a lotta people praying for my downfall
But the only thing that I'll be down for
Is being top five but like down four
I'm down to Earth like the ground floor
But I been fly so long, I tend to ask people what's the ground for
Man I'm only headed up, see my flow volcanic this the fire I erupt
Heard the fans getting rowdy 'cause they haven't had enough
You know I'm running the city, you just running out of luck
Yeah, I said it with my chest
I flow hard, it's no wonder that they easily impressed
I'm so far, but I'm always coming back with something fresh
I never rest, swear you'll never catch this eagle in a nest
I invest my time in the booth I find
The peace I use to piece the boom in my mind
My ex knows this, lemme expose this
She left 'cause she don't wanna be with an explosive
Man, I'm just

Feeling so tall I could give a high five to the pilot
Yeah, family tight, I keep small circle like eyelet
Whoa, inbox full of contracts I sign with a stylus
Yeah, blue faces blowing up like Violet
