		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The gyal dem Schillaci, Sean da Paul
So me give it to, so me give to, so me give it to, to all girls
Five million and forty naughty shorty
Baby girl, all my girls, all my girls, Sean da Paul say

Well, woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa you can be the mom, oh, oh

Make I see the gyal dem bruk out pon the floor
From you don't want no worthless performer (oh, oh)
From you don't want no man weh can't turn you on 
Gyal, make I see your hand dem up on ya (oh, oh)
Cyaan' 'tand pon it long, nah eat no yam
No steam fish, nor no green banana (oh, oh)
But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna

Well, woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa you can be the mom, oh, oh

Bumper exposed and, gyal, you got your chest out
But you no wasters 'cause gyal you impress out (oh, oh)
And if you des out, ah me you fi test out
Cah I got the remedy to make you de-stress out (oh, oh)
Me haffi flaunt it because me God bless out 
And, girl, if you want it you haffi confess out (oh, oh)
Ah nuh lie weh we need, set speed, haffi fi test di mattress out

Well, woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa you can be the mom, oh, oh

Gyal don't say me crazy now
This strange love it ah nuh Bridgette and Flava show (oh, oh)
Time fi we make baby now, so stop gwan like you ah get shady, yo (oh, oh)
Woman don't play me now, 'cause ah no Fred Sanford nor Grady, yo (oh, oh)
My lovin' is the way to go, my lovin' is the way to go

Well, woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa you can be the mom, oh, oh

When you roll with a player like me
With a broda like me, gyal, there is no other (oh, oh)
No need to talk it right here 
Just park it right here, keep it undercover (oh, oh)
From me love how you fit inna yuh blouse 
And you fat inna yuh jeans and me wan discover (oh, oh)
Everything 'bout you, baby girl, can you hear when me utter?

Well, woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa you can be the mom, oh, oh

Make I see the gyal dem bruk out pon the floor
From you don't want no worthless performer (oh, oh)
From you don't want no man weh can't turn you on 
Gyal, make I see your hand dem up on ya (oh, oh)
Cyaan' 'tand pon it long, nah eat no yam
No steam fish, nor no green banana (oh, oh)
But down in Jamaica we give it to you hot like a sauna

Well, woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature fi shelter you from the storm
Oh Lord, gyal, I got the right tactics to turn you on
And girl I wanna be the papa you can be the mom, oh, oh

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
