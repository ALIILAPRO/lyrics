		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four
Whoa, yeah
Yeah

A Friday night, killer queens
Hop a train, on the scene
All the band, is in the wild
Don't you dare touch the dial

We dressed up like a heart attack for you
We dressed up like a heart attack

I'm talkin'
Little jeans, tiny hat
Evan Smith, tiny sax
Drama kings, sing it loud
Drag that shit all over town

Play it like a heart attack for you
We play it like a heart attack

So kiss me on the cheek
Make it a long goodbye
Ooh, and all the modern girls 
(The modern girls)
Shakin' their ass tonight

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, love on a wire
Oh, lookin' for a fight
Ooh, and all the modern boys 
(The modern boys)
Are goin' out tonight

Oh (ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-oh)

Changed my meds, changed the flight
Bodies on, bodies wild
Body cam, only flams
Bleachers band only flams

Playin' it like a heart attack for you
We playin' it like a heart attack

I guess I'm
New Jersey's finest New Yorker
Unreliable reporter
Pop music hoarder
Some guy playin' quarters
But I'm wearin' a heart attack, baby
A Mikey Freedom heart attack

So kiss me on the cheek
Make it a long goodbye
Ooh, and all the modern girls 
(The modern girls)
Shakin' their ass tonight

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, love on a wire
Oh, lookin' for a fight
Ooh, and all the modern boys 
(The modern boys)
Are goin' out tonight

Oh 

(Ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-ohh-oh)
(Ohh-ohh-oh) one, two, three
Let's do this (ohh-ohh-ohh-oh)

So kiss me on the cheek
La-la-la-la, make it a long goodbye
Ooh, and all the modern girls 
(The modern girls)
Shakin' their ass tonight

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, love on a wire
Oh, lookin' for a fight
Ooh, and all the modern boys 
(The modern boys)
Are goin' out tonight

It's like a modern girl (it's for the modern girls)
(It's like a modern girl)
It's like a modern boy, it's for the modern boys
It's like the modern boys
