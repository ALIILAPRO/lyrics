Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (see, you know we don't give a fuck 'bout none' 'round this motherfucker) 
Uh, uh, yeah

('Cause you got a nigga like me out here, nigga)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (uh-huh, I'm on yo' ass nigga, I don't play no games)

Pull up in a all-black Impala four deep, me and my dawg creep
We got one, finna put his ass to sleep
I don't think he seen me comin' when I'm dumpin' hit 'em cross the street
You know we get to stompin' get to runnin' who that at the street (boom, boom, boom)
That street sweeper, that .223 
That bitch gon' hit 'em from his head to his feet
That pussy nigga thought I was one of them other niggas, nah, I ain't sweet
They must ain't told, bitch, I'm a gangsta
Yes sir, I am from the streets (I'm from the streets)
I don't have problems with none of enemies 
They know what's up with me (they know what's up with me, pussy)

I'm known for terrorizin'
Got twelve on my back I swear to God I really done caught hell 'bout it (yeah)
Them bodies and I swear I keep it brick I cannot talk about it (for real)
But the only thing I do is pop my shit that's how I talk about it (for real)
I really don't know nobody like my gang we really 'bout it (yeah)
Nigga step up to the plate I show you we against everybody (battle up)
You know you niggas don't wanna be dead, don't get beheaded
'Cause you know we ready and we four deep, strapped up in Chevys

Pull up in a all-black Impala four deep, me and my dawg creep
We got one, finna put his ass to sleep
I don't think he seen me comin' when I'm dumpin' hit 'em cross the street
You know we get to stompin' get to runnin' who that at the street (boom, boom, boom)
That street sweeper, that .223 
That bitch gon' hit 'em from his head to his feet
That pussy nigga thought I was one of them other niggas, nah, I ain't sweet
They must ain't told, bitch, I'm a gangsta
Yes sir, I am from the streets (I'm from the streets)
I don't have problems with none of enemies 
They know what's up with me (they know what's up)

I don't wanna show these pussy niggas they not a problem (uh-uh)
You know we gonna ride with these choppas (choppas)
You thought it was a biker gang (yeah)
Damn, how we popped him (on God)
He thought we was the Sniper Gang (Sniper Gang)
The money that I got, your money not the same (not the same)
When we step, reppin' smoke a nigga, choo-choo train (choo-choo train)
Smoke a nigga shit up like a chimney, come down like Grinch (like the Grinch)
I'm feelin' like I'm Santa when your ho get on my sleigh (my sleigh)
I pay your bitch rent just to find out where you lay (you lay)
It's money on your head, I know what I do, I don't play (I don't play nigga)
Yeah, this how I play (uh-uh, do not play)
Slimey (I don't play, nigga)

Yeah
Pull up in a all-black Impala four deep, me and my dawg creep
We got one, finna put his ass to sleep
I don't think he seen me comin' when I'm dumpin' hit 'em cross the street
You know we get to stompin' get to runnin' who that at the street (boom, boom, boom)
That street sweeper, that .223 
That bitch gon' hit 'em from his head to his feet
That pussy nigga thought I was one of them other niggas, nah, I ain't sweet
They must ain't told, bitch, I'm a gangsta
Yes sir, I am from the streets (I'm from the streets)
I don't have problems with none of enemies 
They know what's up with me (they know what's up)
