		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah (ayy)
Oh, yeah (ayy)

I'm the one in my zone
All the other kids 삐약
Look at the other fools in sight
What is going on right now?

There is no need to be 
'Cause it's okay (it's okay)
I'm sober, heart is getting warmer and 
So easy to get rid of you, I swear
We don't need nothing, ooh, no

(Yeah, fix on)
I'm givin' you my invitation
Eyes on me, pay attention 
쿵쿵대는 비트 뒤에 분위기는 tangled 
뒤죽박죽 난리 났어 (what)
척하면 척하는 애들과는 우린 멀어
취한 듯 취하지 않아, 느껴 봐봐 너도 what up
터지는 괴성에 발맞춰 터트려 버려 wow

We are lighting up, up

(불놀이야)
(불놀이야)
(말리지 마)
(말리지 마)

Don't kill the fire
'Cause we only have today see
Pop it away
Pop it away
This place is gonna blow soon, take cover

불놀이야
불놀이야
불놀이야
불놀이야
(불놀이야)

I'm the one in my zone
All the other kids 삐약
Look at the fools in my sight
What is going on right now?

Everybody looking at it wrong, no
Thinking that their game's on point, they say so 
We don't need anything, but oh, no, oh, no
You know you have it inside
Something heating you can't hide

(Ahaha) 여기 불이야, 저기 불이야
온 동네 천지가 붉게 춤추네
여기 여기 붙어라, 저기 붙어라
온 동네 천지가 불이 붙을 때

Yeah 두루두루 모여 
We gon' make a fire 
Like a meteor, yeah, yeah
시작 show time, hands up 
We are lighting up, up 

불놀이야
불놀이야
불놀이야
불놀이야
(불놀이야)

I know you feel this deep inside
The trembling excitement you feel it now
Come by my side now
Come to your seat now
We don't need nothing, not at all
To fire up this place tonight 

불들아 타올라라 번쩍
높이 타올라라 번쩍
Burn it up
Fire bomb, bam 
We are lighting up, up

(불놀이야)
(불놀이야)

Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up
Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up 
(불놀이야)
Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up
Burn it up, burn it up, burn it up
