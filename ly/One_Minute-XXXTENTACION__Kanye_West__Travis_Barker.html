		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin', no more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous, ain't no shame in shamin'
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
'Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine!

Ahaha, ooh
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more
Faith, I want more!

One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute, and then the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's
