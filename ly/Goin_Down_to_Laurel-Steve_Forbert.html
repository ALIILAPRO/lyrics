		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well [C] everybody here, [G] seems to like to laugh

[Dmin] Look at Johnny jivin' across [G] the floor

He [C] can play the fool and [G] make a few mistakes, 

[Dmin] But all the same he'll never be [G] a bore

I'm [C] glad to be so young [G] talkin' with my tongue

[D min] Glad to be so careless in [G] my way

[C] Glad to take a chance [G] and play against the odds

[D min] Glad to be so crazy in [G] my day



Well [C] I'm goin' [C/B] down to [A min] Laurel

[G] It's a dirty stinkin' town [Am] yea

[F] But me I know [G] exactly what I'm going to [Am] find 

[C-G-A min] [D min] Little girl [E min] I'm goin' to see

[Am] She is a fool for [C] lovin' me

[F] But she's in love [G] and love's a funny state of [C] mind 

Yes it is (on second chorus)

Well [C] what was that you said [G] when you had a tear

[D min]Rolling down your cheek the [G] other night

[C] I couldn't catch it all [G] there's something going wrong

[D min]I hope you got it straightened out [G] alright

[C] Everything's so loud [G]and everything's so fast

[D min]I here your brother married once [G]again

Yea [C] best of luck and all and [G] try to have some fun

[D min]They tell me this great life can always [G] end

CHORUS

harmonica theme again: [C-G-D min-G]

I'm [C] smilin' from a car, I'm [G] goin' for a drive

[D min]Feel the whistle blowin' breeze gone [G]flying by

[C] Mirror's on the moon, [G] echo in the sun

[D min] See just a touch of madness [G]in my eye

[C]Please don't mention rain, [G] please don't talk of trains

[D min]Please don't mention buildings burning [G]down

[C]Everybody here seems [G] to like to laugh

[D min] Either step in time or just don't hang [G] around
