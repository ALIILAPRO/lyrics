		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have never stood this close to where you want to be
You have always waded in the shallows between me and the deep blue sea

You'd never want me to appear
You never want this to be over 
You never want it to reach out to the edge of time

While you sleep in earthly delight
Someone's flesh is rotting tonight
Like no other to you
What you've done you can not undo

I have always kept you closer than you have known
I am riding in the shadows behind you on a pale white horse

You 'd never want me to appear
You never want this to be over
Someone's flesh is rotting tonight
Like no other to you
What you have done you can not undo

While you sleep in earthly delight
Still your soul will suffer this plight
Like your father in hell
What you've sold you can not unsell

While you sleep in earthly delight
Someone's flesh is rotting tonight
Like no other to you
What you have done you can not undo

While you sleep in earthly delight
Still your soul will suffer this plight
But like a mother would save
Her own child from digging a grave
