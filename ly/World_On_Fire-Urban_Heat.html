		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A taste
heavy on my tongue
Horizon lines.
Another time.
A heart
beats in my ribcage.
Tearing at the seams.
Wish this was just a dream.
A home
bleached out by the sun.
A bed we made
full of salt and ache.
A child
fills its mouth with dirt
and takes my hand.
Help me understand.
And I won't stop.
I'm never gonna stop.
I'm never gonna stop till I die.
And they won't stop.
They're never gonna stop
Till the whole damn world's on fire.
We cracked
the very hull of the Earth
with a fist for a heart.
Is this how it starts?
A quest.
Chasing down fake gold.
The folly of our age.
Oh my god what a waste.
And I won't stop.
I'm never gonna stop.
I'm never gonna stop till I die.
And they won't stop.
They're never gonna stop
Till the whole damn world's a divide
And I won't stop.
I'm never gonna stop.
I'm never gonna stop till I die.
And they won't stop.
They're never gonna stop
Till the whole damn world's on fire.
