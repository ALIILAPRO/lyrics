		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quit moaning about fate and change
Stand up on your feet and rise
With every fall you get the pain, you learn the lesson
Start now, open your eyes

Dead bodies falling from the sky
We are the ape with the vision of the killing
A rain of shame that fills the mines
No other blood in me but mine

Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind you see it all
You're receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself, you change the world

Your heart is pounding in the brain
As they drag you naked in the mud
A devil's dancing in the rain
How could you fall so low?

No, we will never let go
Let us watch them die

Time to open your eyes to this genocide
When you clear your mind you see it all
You're receiving the gold of a better life
When you change yourself, you change the world
