		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I'm back and it's up, PSA (whoa, whoa)
I'm too fleek to take off all my shit at TSA (fleek)
I know we met today, but I'ma need that shit today (straight up)
Might go extra-extra just so I can see they face (Hit-Boy, straight up, damn)

Keep X's and O's and interchange, yeah
Hit three in a row, that's just a game
Big rings in a row all down my fingers
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania

Pass, do you mind? (Yeah) One of a kind
Get you to sign (sign), I took the fine (cash)
Mulholland Drive (skrrt), I hesitate and weave
And hit that line, I hit more, say the least (it's lit)
Got stacks aside, keep that for bro and peeps
With all the 'Raris (straight up), wrist eight, ain't a nigga could tell you
Risqu√© lil' hoes keep tryin', by the end of the day my M's gettin' wired
My own rims for every time we tried
I'm sensei and senseless, same time
Two drank, two cups poured up
I'm insanely down, slowed up
She built round, butt bubbled up
Don't inflame me now, go nuts
I keep flame right by my guts
It was out, but now it's tucked
Know back home they proud of us right now

Bitch, I'm back and it's up, PSA (whoa, whoa)
I'm too fleek to take off all my shit at TSA (fleek)
I know we met today, but I'ma need that shit today (straight up)
Might go extra-extra just so I can see they face (straight up, damn)

Keep X's and O's and interchange, yeah
Hit three in a row, that's just a game
Big rings in a row all down my fingers
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania

(Psycho, whoa, whoa)
Lil' bitch, don't talk to me like I'm not me (no)
Graveyard, up late, shit, I'm with the zombies (up)
Goin' insane, hard to contain, can't miss a beat, my heart is the same
You know it's flame if I'm in this ho with Scottie (yeah)
Long list of problems, long list of blessings (woah)
Makin' sure the first one never out weight the second, yeah
Military with the tactics, multi-million, multi-facet
She like Prince and Michael Jackson, Purple Rain and mirrors dancin' (woah, woah, woah)
Savage Fenty matchin' with the lingerie socks
Didn't know they made them 'til I took 'em off and I popped
Her mama sixty but look twenty-nine and that's a great sign (woah)
Could take over any tri-state without even tryin' (boy)
And I'm prayin' for my exes and my enemies (straight up)
'Cause they gone need all the help they can get if it isn't me (I swear)
Success is a chain reaction, I'm the fuckin' missin' link (uh-huh)
In the world where niggas would do anythin' for everythin', damn (damn)

Keep X's and O's and interchange, yeah
Hit three in a row, that's just a game (game, bitch)
Big rings in a row all down my fingers (whoa)
I can't even hold my baggage claim
Tryna snatch you home, my Lithuania

Yeah
I had to reset it, my credit on venery and go 'head and vet it
I pullin' her hair, talkin' shit in her ear, yeah, I got a lil' fetish
