		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now

Oh you're with him now?
I hit your phone can you tell me how you feel now?
I'ma pull up, I'ma grab the wheel now (yeah)
We was rolling through Southside, we was in the field now (oh)

Said you finna give the...ooo-woo
Its 3AM trying to get your shit laid right now, ooo-woo
Just set it up and I'm there right now, ooo-woo
Just hit me when you want it
Just you, and no one

If its real say you want me right now (yeah)
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now

Jaded off this purple pill
I been sorry, you been sorry
Hide your smile when I'm around girl I know you do
Yeah you got it
Even if you stay there

She said top floor, big man bank deposit
Everybody call the shit a "hoe phase" get up out it
Get it poppin' City girls, skeleton in the closet
Got two shots, one heart, she the baddest (don't run)

Ooo-woo
Its 3AM trying to get your shit laid right now, ooo-woo
Just set it up and I'm there right now, ooo-woo
Just hit me when you want it
Just you, and no

Hey its me I mean you know that
I know I keep calling and texting
I don't meant to be annoying but this is me trying
I don't know if or when you'll ever call me back but ill keep trying
I don't know what else you expect me to do I hope you'll listen to this all the way through

If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now (girl I know you do)
If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now (girl I know you do)
If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
If its real say you want me right now
Say you want me right now
Say you want me right now

I wish you'd answer my calls and texts I've been a mess
And I know I deserve it the silent treatment
But I hope there will be an end to it
Will there be an end to it?
How long are you gonna shut me out for?
I mean do you really not think about us anymore?
Do you really not care like you did before?
Will we ever be the same?
Can I ever make amends we really won't ever be friends again?
Is this where we end?
If that's what you want if that's the message you're trying to send then ill leave you alone
It'll be hard but ill leave you alone.
