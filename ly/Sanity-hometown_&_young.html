		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sanity, I lost all of my vanity
Playing the crowds of sold out shows
Everybody knows that alcohol numbs the pain

And I've been far from home for so long

Disassociation tears at my throat
My mind is in a world of its own
I just want to fall Back asleep

Pain, I'll take it any other way, it's not enough to feel the same as I did last year oh no
The sky, in turn turns black and feels uncontrolled, and I can't feel my heart or my soul, and does Nobody know depression takes hold

I'm feeling okay
but I'm sicker today I'm sick I'm insane,
I pick up the pace
Because everybody wants me to know
what I'm gonna say
I'm feeling myself, I'm feeling myself like nobody else, and when my time comes you best believe I'm going to hell, and enjoy my stay

To all of those, who think they're all alone, don't try to bite the bullet, just try to stay woke, and though the sun will set the east will have its glow

I've tried before, to let you go, but it's your smile and scent that imma miss the most, totally honest now I think my life's a joke

Sanity, I lost all of my vanity
Playing the crowds of sold out shows
Everybody knows that alcohol numbs the pain

And I've been far from home for so long

Disassociation tears at my throat
My mind is in a world of its own
I just want to fall Back asleep

Sanity, I lost all of my vanity
Playing the crowds of sold out shows and
Everybody knows that alcohol will numb the pain
