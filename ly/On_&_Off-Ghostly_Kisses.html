		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night, I heard your name
You know it felt the same
They told me you moved back into your place

You're so close but yet far
I always wonder how you are
From the morning's light to the night's embrace

We move in waves
Hopeless fate
Cause I know, it's who we are
We've tried it all
On and off
And I know

We're far from the best time we've ever known
So much time has passed now, and you never called
We used to be close, sharing each other's views
Will you let me in somehow?
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love (with someone else)

Last time I saw your face
Felt the depth of your gaze
Through your eyes, I felt I always belonged

But when you met someone
We got lost and didn't talk
This complicated dance, we didn't try to end

I lost myself
In countless ways
But I know, it's just who we are
We've tried it all
On and off
And I know

We're far from the best time we've ever known
So much time has passed now, you never called
We used to be close, sharing each other's views
Will you let me in somehow?
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Falling in love
Let me in without falling in love (with someone else)
