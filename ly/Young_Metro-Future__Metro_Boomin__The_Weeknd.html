		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Yeah, yeah
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah, yeah)
Okay, okay, okay

Evel Knievel 
Pluto tote his heaters, "Leave nigga in the freezer"
I'm big as a Beatle (okay, okay)
Fuck on a diva, I'm hot than a fever (woo)
Put dope in one liters, more stripes than Adidas (okay, okay)
I got these regular hoes, I got superstar hoes takin' pictures of me like the feds
Check out my video, lil' bitty silly ho
Got me with a mill' in jewelry, in the bed (okay, okay)

Grip the forty, while I'm sleep, in my hand (drink it up)
Drink the dope and I get cool as a fan (drink it up)
Turbo motor hot, I'm scorchin' in France (skrrt-skrrt)
Bitch, you bogus if you don't bring a friend (bitch, you bogus)
Came from nothin', you can't feel what I'm sayin' (came up)
Hundred shots, I gotta stick to the plan (one hundred)
Sloppy-toppy gotta get it again
Shorty boppin', she just pushin' the brand
Solo, but the hitters pullin' up on demand
Chauffeured in the Phantom, I get standards when I land
I ain't never sober, I got pills and I'm sharin'
Cop a new hammer with the cooler, it don't jam
Took the show on the road gettin' bands on bands
On the high, on the low, I'm the man, I'm the man (man)
Strikin' off, strikin' off, Porsche Cayenne (strike out)
Live it up, ran it up, got it expand

I been drownin'
I been tryin'
I been low
All alone (oh, oh, oh)
Say you want me (oh, oh, oh)
Freebandz
I been drownin'

Yeah, yeah (I been drownin')
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro (I been drownin')
Yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah

Got the hood in the choke and that's my bitch
I'm a mogul, that make her a boss bitch (oh, woah)
I'ma float on this shit like the coast clear
I put dope on my block, make the dope flip (oh, woah)
I got work on me, nigga, I got dog shit
Get you hit in yo' shit, it won't cost shit
Take a load and run through it in one minute
When that mud in my system, I function
Took a freestyle and turned it to cash
I get flyer than you, this not a caption
When I got in this shit, I got hot in this shit
I came through in a coupe, I was smashin' (oh, woah)
I was good in the hood servin' 'Phetamine
Gettin' a billion to see what's ahead of me (oh, woah)
My real day ones, they ready catch felonies
Goin' Richard Mille for the whole team
Tote a stick and throw dice at the curb
Ho, go fuck on a nigga I birthed
If she lose, that's a choice and a curse
You lil' niggas, I take you to church (oh, woah)

Yeah, yeah
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro (oh, woah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay, okay (oh, woah)
No, no
Lord, no
Okay, okay (Lord, have mercy)
Okay, okay (Jesus)

Evel Knievel 
Pluto tote his heaters, "Leave nigga in the freezer"
I'm big as a Beatle (okay, okay, Jesus)
Fuck on a diva, I'm hot than a fever (woo)
Put dope in one liters, more stripes than Adidas (okay, okay, Jesus)
I got these regular hoes, I got superstar hoes takin' pictures of me like the feds
Check out my video, lil' bitty silly ho
Got me with a mill' in jewelry, in the bed (okay)

I need you
Okay, okay
Okay, okay
