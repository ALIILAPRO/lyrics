		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey, come on, let's get the band up)

Don't play that song for me
Though it brings back sweet memories
Of the days that I once knew
Of the days I spent with you

Oh no, don't you let it play
It fills my heart with pain
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just-a what it said

Well it said
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, you know that you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, you know that you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Darling, you know that you lied (you lied), you lied (you lied)
You lie, lie, lie, lied

I remember on our first date
You kissed me then you walked away
You were only seventeen
I never thought you'd act so mean

But you told me that you loved me
And you told me that you cared
You said you'd go with me, darling
Oh, anytime, anywhere

But, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Yeah, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, you know that you lied (you lied, you lied)
You lie, lie, lie, lied

woo

I remember those summer nights down by the shore
As the band played, with you in my arms
And we moved across that floor
Then, darling, you went away
But all I've got to say is
I don't care if you lied
Let's dance

But, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Yeah, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling you lied (you lied), you lied (you lied)
You lie, lie, lie, lied

(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling you lied (you lied), you lied (you lied)
You lie, lie, lie, lied

(Darling, I love you)
You know that you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Yeah, darling, you lied
(Darling, I love you)
Oh, darling you lied (you lied), you lied (you lied)
You lie, lie, lie, lied

(Darling, I love you)
(Darling, I love you)
(Darling, I love you)
