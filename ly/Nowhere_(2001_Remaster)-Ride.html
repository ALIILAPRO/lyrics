		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should have known better,
Than to expect it all.
You want everything,
And you end up grabbing at air.

I had so much to give,
So much hope, we held each other high.
But the heroes are gone,
And all that's left is you and me.

I learned the hard way,
That life should be easy,
But I want you to know it was hard to show,
The things that I know now.

And all that's left is you and me,
And here we are,
Nowhere.
