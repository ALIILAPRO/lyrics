		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand

I'll never beat you
I'll never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by

'Cause you, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend

No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah and you're the reason why

'Cause you, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

You're just a sinner I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad

I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscious 
I am love
All I really need is to know that
You believe 

Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you

Yeah, say one more time

You, I would die for you 
Darling if you want me to
You, I would die for you
Two, three, four you

I would die for you 
I would die for you 
You, I would die for you 
You, I would die for you
