		<p>
		  Gravity on me never let me down gently
Gravity with me never let me go no no
Gravity

I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you

I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you

Gravity on me never let me down gently
Gravity with me never let me go no no
Gravity

I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you

I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on me
I don't pull me down
I don't pull me down on you
