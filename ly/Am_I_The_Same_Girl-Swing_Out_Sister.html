		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don´t you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?

Why don´t you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who knew your soul?

I´m the one you want
And I´m the one you need
I´m the one you love
I´m the one you used to meet

Around the corner
Everyday
We would meet
And slip away
But we were much too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Why don´t you stop
And look me over
Am I the same girl you used to know?
Why don´t you stop
And think it over
Am I the same girl who knew your soul?
I´m the one you hurt
And I´m the one you need
I´m the one who cried
I´m the one you used to meet
But you are pretending you don´t care
But the fire is still there
Now we are no longer too young
To love each other this way

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)

Have you ever felt the need for something more
With every week comes scratching at your door
Have you ever stopped and wonder what it is you´re searching for
Push your luck too far with me
But if you push it any further
You won´t have any

Am I the same girl?
Am I the same girl?
(Yes I am, yes I am)
