		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And my love is impossible
So hard to control, I
My heart is a beautiful
Kind of wrecking ball, I

I know I get a little bit crazy
Out of my head, yeah, maybe it's too much
But if you really wanna be with me
You gotta handle all that I got

Can you work, work, work with my love? (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love? (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love? (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love? (My love)

And I know it's a wild ride
But it's worth the fight, I
And oh, if you hold on tight
We can rule the night, I

I know I get a little bit crazy
Out of my head, yeah, maybe it's too much
But if you really wanna be with me
You gotta handle all that I got

Can you work, work, work with my love? (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love? (My love)
(Can you work with my)

Can you work, work, work with my love?
(Can you work? Can you work? Can you work with my love, baby?)
Can you work, work, work with my love?
(Can you work? Can you work?) (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love?
Can you work with my? Work with my? Work with my, work with my, my love? (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love?
Can you work with my? Work with my? Work with my, work with my, my love? (My love)
Can you work, work, work with my love?
