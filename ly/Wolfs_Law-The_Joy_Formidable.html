		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me the way you've been (so long)
I want to go along and pretend that it's dawn
That's the start not the close
I'm your friend not your post
We're under Wolf's Law

Another new scene that flies
Another empty picture for this collage of mine
Want to pull it back
And pretend that it's dark
That we made it here unharmed
I'm your friend not your guard
And we're under Wolf's Law

I'll take the gambling way
Let's send it spiraling
Just to visit that box
Don't wait, let's go, go, go

Don't wait, let's go, go, go
