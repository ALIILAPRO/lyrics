		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bullet in yo vest, bullet in yo vest
Shawty wanna love me, to me it's way more than the sex
I can see it in yo eyes that you ain't even at yo best
If I was sleepin' on a couch do you think you'd pass the test

There is not a friend that I have cut off and regret
Sometimes late at night I get too sad want to reset
Every now and then I slit my wrists when I'm a mess
Every now and then I trip up then I send a text

We can fuck until you sleep or we can fuck until you tap out
She don't wanna see me now and it's because I'm on the map now
Heard you gotta new man hit that fuckboy wit a blackout
I see demons in the night, tell me did you see them lashout

I remember all the ways and days and the she would ever melt
I remember all the days and ways that you would give me Hell
Now I'm glad I'll never ever ever hear a wedding bell
Tell me why I am still caught up and bound up in your spell

Tell me why am I still caught up and bound up in your spell
I remember crying out to God alone for fucking help
Tell me why are you the only that left me in a spell
Tell me why am I the only that ever really fell
I'm inside in the club with all them drugs that you can't smell
Shawty wanna love me but it feels like I'm Hell

We can fuck until you sleep or we can fuck until you tap out
She don't wanna see me now and it's because I'm on the map now
Heard you gotta new man hit that fuckboy wit a blackout
I see demons in the night, tell me did you see them lashout
