		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're friends are right it's jodeci
But the song is called freak'n you

I wanna freak you Everytime I close my eyes
I wake up feelin' so horny
I can't get you outta my mind
Sexin' you be all I see
I would give anything
Just to make you understand me
I don't give a damn about nothing else
Freek'n you is all I see

Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight you won't be sorry
Tonight, you got my mind
You got my mind, all I wanna do is freak you

What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you
What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you
Oooh, I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last 'cause I'm a freak
Turned on by everything you say
I'm turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you

Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight you got my mind

What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you
What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you

Oooh, I could go on for days
But I couldn't go on for weeks
I can even play with another body
But it wouldn't last 'cause I'm a freak
Turned on by everything you say
I'm turned on by everything you do
And at night when I close my eyes
I only dream of freek'n you

Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight you got my mind

What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you
What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you

Freek out and freek me up and down
DeVante Swing freek out
And freek me up and down
Freek out and freek me up and down

Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you baby in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day, every freek'n night
I wanna freek you girl
Your body's so freek'n tight

Every freek'n night and every freek'n day
I wanna freek you baby in every freek'n way
Every freek'n day, every freek'n night
I wanna freek you girl
Your body's so freek'n tight

What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you
What must I say what must I do
To show how much i think about freek'n you
What must I say what must I do
To show how much I think about freek'n you
I think about freek'n you i wanna freek you
