		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  1,  2,  fuck this place up. 

We turn desire to fire electric spark to the wire 
Highered the stakes when we brought this monster 
Life prevail by daring to fail others content just to sail 
Hail the future we bring 

We bring chaos to blocks like riots to watts blow up spots  
Taking the crown off the top notch 
Create the pace that you all will follow 

Sporadic flow buckles up like a calico 
We do smoke sensmilla vodka and see-O-K-E is the real deal 
You flubber, never had to suffer 
Life's gettin harder and it's only getting rougher 
Save some for me can't stop what were going to be 

[Chorus] 
Walk with me and take this seed a fire for you so dare to fail will you 

When my pen hits pad it results in catastrophe 
Words and verbs come to form a disaster 
If you want it, you got it never hit I spot it 
Now come and watch me rise 

All the tools, that blew more money than Latrell 
You tell, I don't know you think I know you too well you fell 
And stumbled laughin' as you tumbled 
I guess you forgot about the power we rock 
'Cause "all hate the" Machine Head battery 

The good, the bad, the ugly 
Damaging your battery yeah you been fucked stuck in a rut 
Your life has been sucked your tail has been tucked 

Save some for me can't stop what were going to be 
Just watch as as I demonstrate the reason we dominate 

[Chorus]

If we stand alone and believe it all and you tell me it's all I believe in 
Yes we stand alone and believe it all if you tell me it's all we believe in 
Because we we'll chew and spit you out 
And pray upon the weaker 
Take what we want 

[Chorus]
