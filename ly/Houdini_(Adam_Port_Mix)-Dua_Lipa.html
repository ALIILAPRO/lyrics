		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is passin' like a solar eclipse
See you watchin' and you blow me a kiss
It's your moment, baby, don't let it slip
Come in closer, are you readin' my lips?

They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows
Catch me or I go Houdini

If you're good enough, you'll find the way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay

Everything you say is soundin' so sweet
But do you practice everythin' that you preach?
I need something that'll make me believe
If you got it, baby, give it to me

They say I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini

If you're good enough, you'll find the way
Maybe you could cause a girl to change (her ways)
Do you think about it night and day?
Maybe you could be the one to make me stay

I come and I go
Tell me all the ways you need me
I'm not here for long
Catch me or I go Houdini (hahaha)
I come and I go (I come and I go)
Prove you got the right to please me
Everybody knows (I'm not here for long)
Catch me or I go Houdini

Ooh
I come and I go
I'm not here for long (catch me or I go Houdini)
