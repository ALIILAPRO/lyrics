		  (Wheezy outta here)
YSL Music Group

From the other world to the world to the other world, lonely
I done fucked her and another girl and another girl on me
I done ran'd up these racks and now I got Christmas under the tree (ran up)
Though my dawg'ndem sat, they ain't say nothin', that's on me (yeah)
I don't wanna talk about nothin', I don't wanna know 'bout no beefs (yeah)
Need a pen to jot it down, I'm tryna forever remember this (yeah, yeah)
I was tryna shoot 'em down, I don't wanna forever diss (ha)
Be quiet, let me count every dime without a miss (shh)
I done ran'd up the bag, now red bottoms on my feet
You can wake up to drapes and heated floors on your feet (yeah)
Señoritas, I'ma buy you a Richard Mille, all VV's
Señoritas (señoritas), señorita (oh, yeah)
Señorita ('rita), gotta re-up (whoa-whoa)
Father, we up, my feet up (oh)
Send the weed up with a fever
Can't ease up without seein' us
I gotta rebuild, not mad at all
For YSL, puttin' on for my dawgs
I got gratitude and lattitude
A bougie nigga, put my kids all in charter school (ya)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(And I just wanna know if you love me, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I just wanna know, yeah)

Droppin' off the top with the mileage backed up
Break it down and twirl it around, it add up (ayy)
Hella people 'round the town get fast dough (racks)
Eighty-seven Kaepernick thousand on the Rollie
I can always see the devil harassin' me
Tellin' me he lovin' me while stabbin' me (yeah)
Niggas tellin' 'round this bitch, it's a hobby (no cap)
Lost control on the road with a body (skrrt, skrrt)
You bionic, give a nigga stamina (stamina)
I don't spare none, niggas gon' get banned out
I take my .9 out, really wanna find out
You got your hands out because I'm passin' bands out
I lost my virginity into Amanda
I'll these fuckin' yellow diamonds, Tropicana
Bunch of old ass bitches tryna fuck us
They'll be fuckin' on my grandson (ya)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(And I just wanna know if you love me, baby)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I just wanna know, yeah)
