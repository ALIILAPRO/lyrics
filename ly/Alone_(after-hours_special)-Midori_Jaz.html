		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think I'm crazy
Yeah I am
Yeah I am
You think she not even trying
Yeah I am
Yeah I am
People don't really give me credit for certain things
Please don't take it personal if I don't answer your call
I don't really like to hang no more
If I made plans with you, its a no-show
You'd think she gotta be tired of this shit
Yeah I am
Yeah I am
Hmm
Hmm
Hmm
Rather smoke my jay in my lonesome (hmm)
Fake friends and drama I don't want none (hmm)
I can't give a fuck, I don't have one
Pretty face but I like to play with guns
Alone in my moody lights, no sun
I don't wanna be with just anyone
I don't wanna be just another one
This is why I can't be with anyone
I rather be alone
You think I'm crazy
Yeah I am
Yeah I am
You think she not even trying
Yeah I am
Yeah I am
(I rather be alone
I rather be alone)
