		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall

(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(Twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall

Soaking through

(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes) 
(I twisted the knife and)

Ah, she looked into your eyes
And saw what laid beneath
Don't try to save yourself
The circle is complete
We're reaching out and to tell you
Nothing else can touch me

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall

Soaking through

(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes) 

Ah, she looked into your eyes
And saw what laid beneath
Don't try to save yourself
The circle is complete

(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and)

Fading gently
Soaking through
And starting not to show at all
We're reaching out and to take you
Nothing else can touch me

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall

Soaking through

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall, rinse me (I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
