		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What we gotta do right here is go back, back to the top

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

Say, I'm thinking 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singing in the shower
Picking petals off the flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (love me not)
I ain't a player, I just crush a lot (crush a lot)

You give me that kind of something
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I'm at 100
Never get enough, I can't stay away

If you want it, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it) the way you love me

Oh, it's so crazy you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain't a question (question)
'Cause boy, I know just what you like

So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you'll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave you
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

So don't you worry, baby, you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way (I love it) the way I love you

Uh, I make you feel so fine, I make you feel so fine
I hope you hit me on my celly when I sneak in your mind
You're a princess to the public, but a freak when it's time
Said your bed be feeling lonely, so you're sleeping in mine
You come and watch a movie with me
American Beauty or Bruce Almighty, that's groovy
Just come and move closer to me, I got some feelings for you
I'm not gonna get bored of, but baby you're an adventure
So please let me come explore you

So don't you worry, baby you got me

I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don't know how you did it
And I don't care who sees it babe
I don't wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)

I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)
Baby, I love the way (you make me feel)
I love the way (I love it)

The way I love you
The way I love you, you, you, yeah

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it
The way I love you
