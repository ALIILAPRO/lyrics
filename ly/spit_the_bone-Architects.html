		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now we're all cannibals

Say this will all be temporary
Even the mark by my name
The flames are all imaginary
Just be happy there's slack in the chain

We must be extraordinary
Watch who you're worshipping
'Cause we've been feeding
Swallowing a hand grenade
We won't let the bleeding stop

It's holier below me
We all play dead
But everybody knows one halo
Beneath the payload
We had it all
Now we're all cannibals
Now we're all cannibals

I'm more than just a mercenary
There's always a shake to my aim
Pray it was all imaginary
Were we banking those ill-gotten gains?

We must be extraordinary
Watch who you're worshipping
'Cause we've been feeding
Swallowing a hand grenade
We won't let the bleeding stop

It's holier below me
We all play dead
But everybody knows one halo
Beneath the payload
We had it all
Now we're all cannibals

If you're gonna burn that bridge
Then you'd better learn to paddle
But I bet you don't, I saw you when you burnt the boat
Read my lips, if you're deafened by the rattle
If you chew it up
Don't forget to spit the bone
Spit the bone
Don't forget to spit

If you're gonna burn that bridge
Then you'd better learn to paddle
But I bet you don't, I saw you when you burnt the boat
Read my lips, if you're deafened by the rattle
If you chew it up
Don't forget to spit the bone

We all play dead
But everybody knows one halo
Beneath the payload
We had it all

But now it's holier below me
We all play dead
But everybody knows one halo
Beneath the payload
We had it all
Now we're all cannibals
