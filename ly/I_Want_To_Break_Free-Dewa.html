		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to break free i want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you
Love me like you do but I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free
Oh how I want to break free

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you
Love me like you do but I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free
Oh how I want to break free
Oh I want to break free

I want to break free i want to break free
I want I want I want i want to break free
I want I want I want i want to break free
