		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is erosion
Grinding up rocks with your molars
A big fish swims past your rod
You can't catch it, it's far too fast
Deep hook marks in rubber lips
I see your eyes in the flowers
I'll pick a bunch for your room
Green and blue to match your pictures

You looked so good in green
I hope you're well
And you look so good with him
And I'm proud of you still
I miss your perfect teeth i was too blunt
I hope you feel happy that's all I want
That's all I want

Mess in the kitchen i was so disappointed
I guess I got to my head
And I was too young to understand it
I get it now that it's too late
I never stopped feeling guilty
I'm over it, I promise that
I just gotta sing it out of me

You looked so good in green
I hope you're well
And you look so good with him
And I'm proud of you still
Take care of my shirt warm and red
I hope you think of me still as your friend
I hope you love yourself your body and heart
I hope you feel happy that's all I want
That's all I want
