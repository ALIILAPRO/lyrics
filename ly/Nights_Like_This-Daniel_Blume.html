		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On nights like this
My judgement slips
And I end up falling back to
The love we stole
By letting go
Wanna pull you close on nights like this

This
Nights like this
This
Nights like this
This
Nights like this
This, yeah

On nights like this
It's all at risk
But I can't not think about you
My heart beats cold
From letting go
Wanna pull you close on nights like this
This
Nights like this
This
Nights like this
This
Nights like this
This, yeah

I've tried to quit
But nights like this
Got me burning up without you
It comes and goes
And takes control
On a night like this
When I start

Thinking that I'm free
You come back to me
My heart takes a hold
It goes round and round on
My mind constantly
You're stuck on repeat
Feelings never go
Want to pull you close on

On nights like this
It's all at risk
But I can't not think about you
My heart beats cold
From letting go
Wanna pull you close on nights like this
This
Nights like this
This
Nights like this
This
Nights like this
This, yeah

On nights like this
It's all at risk
But I can't not think about you
My heart beats cold
From letting go
Wanna pull you close on nights like this
