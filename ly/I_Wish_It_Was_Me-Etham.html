		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Known each other since forever
You always seem to have my heart
Said that we'd end up together
I never knew where to start

And every time you find somebody
You tell me how you think they're the one
It's hard for me to take
You love me in a way that I don't want

You look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And, darling, I wish it was me
I wish it was me

Always hoped I'd be the reason
The reason you can't sleep at night
The one you miss so much, you're barely breathing
The face you see when you turn out the lights

And every time you've got nobody
I'm thinking maybe I could be the one
It's hard for me to take
You love me in a way that I don't want

You look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And, darling, I wish it was me
The music fades, the lights come on
And I just want to take you home
But you whisper to him that you're ready to leave
And, darling, I wish it was me
I wish it was me

And I almost told you, a million times
Always tripping over words I never seem to find
Just a little closer, it's getting harder to hide
I keep losing the lines
But the answer's right there in your eyes

You look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And, darling, I wish it was me

Oh, you look at me like I'm someone
You only need when it goes wrong
But you look at him like he's your missing piece
And, darling, I wish it was me (darling, I wish it was me)
The music fades, the lights come on
And I just want to take you home
But you whisper to him that you're ready to leave
And, darling, I wish it was me
I wish it was me
