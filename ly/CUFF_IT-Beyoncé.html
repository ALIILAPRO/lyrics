		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel like fallin' in love (fallin' love)
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up (tonight, I'm fuckin' somethin' up, baby)
I need some drink in my cup (I need a drink)
Hey (pour me a drink)
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up (I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up)

I wanna go missin'
I need a prescription
I wanna go higher, can I sit on top of you? (Ooh-la-la-la, la-la-la)
I wanna go where nobody's been (wanna go where nobody's been)
Have you ever had fun like this? (Have you ever had fun? Yeah)

We gon' fuck up the night, black lights
Spaceships fly (spaceships fly)
Yeah, unapologetic when we fuck up the night
Fuck up the night
We gettin' fucked up tonight
We gon' fuck up the night

Bet you you'll see far
Bet you you'll see stars
Bet you you'll elevate
Bet you you'll meet God
'Cause I feel like fallin' in love
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up
'Cause we gon' fuck up the night

What's in these four walls?
You sexy, my love (turn it up)
Don't miss this roll-call
Is you here or what? (Roll it up)
Yeah, show up, show up (show up, show up)
Po' up, po' up (po' up, po' up)
Uh, you Mr. Nasty, I'll clean it up

Go where nobody's been (wanna go where nobody's been)
Have you ever had fun like this? (Have you ever had fun? Yeah)
I wanna go missin'
I need a prescription
I wanna go higher, can I sit on top of you? 

We gon' fuck up the night (funk it up, funk it up)
Black lights
Spaceships fly (spaceships fly)
Yeah, unapologetic when we fuck up the night (funk it up, funk it up)
Fuck up tonight
We gettin' fucked up tonight
We gon' fuck up the night

Bet you you'll see far
Bet you you'll see stars
Bet you you'll elevate
Bet you you'll meet God
'Cause I feel like fallin' in love
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up
We gon' fuck up the night

Hypersonic, sex erotic
On my body, boy, you got it
Hit them 'draulics, while I ride it
Got me actin' hella thotty
So excited, so exotic
I'm a seasoned professional
Squeeze it, don't let it go
Tease it, no self control
I got time today (I got time today, I got time)
Oh, I (I got time today, I got time)
I can't wait 'to come out and play
Ooh, yeah you
Come and cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, cuff it, baby
While I buss it, buss it, buss it, for you baby, ayy
Oh, baby
Anywhere, any time 
I don't mind, I don't mind

Yeah (I don't mind)
For you (all for you)
I'm backin' the truck up, huh (back that truck up)
For you (all for you, for you)
A bitch'll get fucked up, huh (I fucked her up)
For you (all for you)
I'm puttin' my cup up, huh (put my cup up, yeah)
For you (all for you, you)

'Cause we gon' fuck up the night
Take flight (woo), blindin' lights (yeah)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up
(Unapologetic when we fuck up the night)
Bet you you'll see stars (night)
Bet you you'll go far (night)
Bet you you'll levitate (night)
Bet you you'll meet God (party people, roll up)
Ooh (yeah)
We gon' fuck up the night (huh, yeah)
Spaceships fly
Fuck it up, fuck it up
