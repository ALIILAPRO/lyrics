		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been dreaming about you
For a long time in my mind
I've been seeing your face
In the light on the hill
I can't help thinking
It's been a long time now
I've been wondering
How you've been
Well the last time we spoke
There was a pain in your heart
You said the rain just falls
Every day on you
And I couldn't help you anymore
But I can tell you now
You've gotta climb those
Heavy tears

Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Wash all your fears away

Well it's hard when you've got that pain
Like a thorn in your side
And it's calling out your name
And it burns like a fire
Well I can't take it away
It's a shadow in the night
But I can tell you
I keep on climbing now

Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Wash all your fears away

Like a summer sun falls
And the light just fades away
There's a moon rising high
To keep you on your way
When you're lost in a dream
When you're lost in your head
That's just the place that you are
And it's the road you're on
There's a time to rest
There's a time to move on

Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Wash all your fears away
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Like a ladder to a rose, baby
Climb on your tears
Wash all your fears away
