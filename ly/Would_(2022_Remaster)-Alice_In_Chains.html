		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know me broken by my master
Teach thee on child, love of hereafter

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Drifting body, it's sole desertion
Flying not yet, quite the notion

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way

Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home?
Have I gone?
And left you here alone?

Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home? Yeah
Have I gone?
And left you here alone?

If I would, could you?
