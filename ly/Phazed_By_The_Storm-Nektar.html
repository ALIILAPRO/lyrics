		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fathers of the stars we came and now we part
You know, you know only time will tell
The answers to our dreams at night

Saviour of our hearts
We came in peace with god it seems
It seems we're searching for amends
For the children we won't see again

Old man sitting in his daydream
A romance, a book that no-one else sees
But he knows
There's some things that we can't be
He's the giver and spirit of a mans dream

Please take it away i can't stay anymore
Phazed, phazed by the storm
I can't take anymore

Old man, the day you came to see me
You gave me more than just a vision
It was a passion, my heavy heart became free
Free to wonder and taste the
Fruit of life's tree

Please take it away i can't stay anymore
I'm phazed, phazed by the storm
I can't stay in this world
Please take me away

Old man sitting in his daydream
No one knows what he's thinking
Let your mind stroll, let your heart roam
Don't you know you're phazed by the storm

Old man sitting in his daydream
No one knows what he's thinking
Let your mind stroll, let your heart roam
Don't you know you're phazed by the storm

Old man sitting in his daydream
No one knows what he's thinking
Let your mind stroll, let your heart roam
Don't you know you're phazed by the storm

Old man sitting in his daydream
No one knows what he's thinking
Let your mind stroll, let your heart roam
Don't you know you're phazed by the storm

Old man sitting in his daydream
No one knows what he's thinking
Let your mind stroll, let your heart roam
Don't you know you're phazed by the storm

Old man sitting in his daydream
No one knows what he's thinking
Let your mind stroll, let your heart roam
Don't you know you're phazed by the storm
