		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shangri-La out on the West side
In the blinding night oh why
Where they swing their arms out by the roadside
Like a baby doll oh why

Damn this floor is thumpin' spring released and
My little girlfriend's hanging light
I feel the blood rush pumpin' haulin'

Late July fire in the dance hall
Honey where am I stuck to the wall
Out on the rim of space up by the bandstand
Don't I know my place always

Damn this floor is thumpin' spring released and (spring released ah)
My little girlfriend's hanging light (she's hanging light)
I feel the blood rush pumpin' haulin' (I feel the blood rush)
My little girlfriend she's a hanging tight

Pale eyes don't show your weakness
On the town tonight oh why
Pale heart don't cut your wrist up
'Cause ya can't decide oh why would ya

Damn this floor is thumpin' spring released and (spring released ah)
My little girlfriend she's hanging light (she's hanging light)
I feel the blood rush pumpin' haulin' (I feel the blood rush)
My little girlfriend she's a hanging light
She's a hanging light

Damn this floor is thumpin' spring released and (spring released ah)
My little girlfriend she's hanging light (she's hanging light)
I feel the blood rush pumpin' haulin' (I feel the blood rush)
My little girlfriend she's a hanging light (she's hanging light)

Damn this floor is thumpin' spring released and (spring released ah)
My little girlfriend's hanging light (she's hanging light)
I feel the blood rush pumpin' haulin' (I feel the blood rush)
My little girlfriend she's a hanging light

Damn this floor is thumpin' spring released and
My little girlfriend's hanging light
