		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Underneath the monlight of old hungerian skies 
buried in the blood-drenched earth 
These barren lands of ice 
She was an evil woman with an evil old soul 
Piercing eyes emotionless 
a heart so black and cold 

Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul 
Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death 
You're still alive, Elizabeth 

Her pact with Satan 
Her dispisal of mankind 
Her acts of cruelty and her lust for blood 
Makes her one of us 

Our ancient countess was refused her desires will 
To bathe in pure fresh blood 
She'd peasant virgins killed 

Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul 
Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death 
You're still alive, Elizabeth 

Elizabeth, in the chasm where was my soul 
Forever young, Elizabeth Bathorii in the castle of your death 
You're still alive, Elizabeth
