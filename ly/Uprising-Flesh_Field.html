		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put my faith in your betrayal. 
I knew full well what you would do.
Have you no conscience? 
Have you no respect?
I've got my pride, something I will protect. 

This was just the first time.
But it won't be the last time you hurt me.

Nothing left to say as all your will decays. 
Nothing left to do but put an end to you. 

I sold my soul to you,
And you destroyed the world I thought I knew.
Consumed by the god of the green;
Your longevity remains to be seen. 

No more games.
And no more lies. 
No one to blame. 
No alibis.
I am ashamed to be part of your apathy.
All that I couldn't see, 
A part of this system of greed.
