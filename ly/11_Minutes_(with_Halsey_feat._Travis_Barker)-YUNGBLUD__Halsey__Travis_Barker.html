		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?

I think I missed you callin' on the other line
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind
Talkin' love but I can't even read the signs
I would sell my soul for a bit more time
You stain all on my body like you're red wine
You're the fuckin' acid to my alkaline
You run your middle finger up and down my spine
I'm sorry there was no one to apologize

I'm so fuckin' sorry, I'm so fuckin' sorry
I've been playing somebody and it's helping nobody
And her lipstick arithmetic didn't stick
And now I'm sick, throwing fits
And yeah, I've seen you in my head every fuckin' day since I left
You on the floor with your hands 'round your head
And I'm down and depressed
All I want is your head on my chest
Touchin' feet, I'm 11

I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here?

Tell me what you need, I can make you more than what you are
Come and lay the roses on the floor, every single Sunday, don't get bored
I just want to freeze, I can give you more than what you are
Now I see you standing all alone, I never thought the world would turn to stone

So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head

I'm 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
I'm 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here? (Why aren't you here?)
You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
You're 11 minutes away, so why aren't you here? (Why aren't you here?)

So call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head
Call me stupid, call me sad
You're the best I've ever had
You're the worst I've ever had
And that keeps fuckin' with my head

You're 11 minutes away and I have missed you all day
So why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
Why aren't you here?
