		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna get a ticket to ride
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side

Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me
'Bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet
And get along with it all

Go down where the people say "Y'all"
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game, start playin' again

I'd like to stay
But I might have to go to start over again
Might go back down to Texas
Might go to somewhere that I've never been

And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song, start singin' again

I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin'
For answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories
Just to have somewhere to go

Count the days and the nights that it takes
To get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay, turn the night into day
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound station
Gonna get a ticket to ride
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids
And sit down by her side

Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me
'Bout two or three times
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
Start talkin' again when I know what to say
