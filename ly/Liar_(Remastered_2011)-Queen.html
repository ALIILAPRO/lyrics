		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have sinned dear, Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in? Liar
Oh nobody believes me, liar
Ooh, why don't you leave me alone?
Sire I have stolen, stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should
Liar, oh everybody deceives me
Liar, ooh, why don't you leave me alone?

Liar, I have sailed the seas
Liar, from mars to mercury
Liar, I have drunk the wine
Liar, time after time
Liar, you're lying to me
Liar, you're lying to me
Father please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please will you direct me in the right way
Liar liar liar liar
Liar that's what they keep calling me
Liar liar liar

Ooh, let me go

Listen, are you gonna listen?
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
Mama I'm gonna try behave
All day long
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
All day long
I'm gonna serve you 'til your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna keep you 'til your dying day
All day long
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
All day long and pray
All day long and pray
All day long and pray
All day long, wow, all day long, wow
All day long, all day long, all day long
Yes, all day long, all day long, all day long, all day long, yeah
All day long, we have lift off, ow

All day long, all day long, all day long
Liar liar they never ever let you win
Liar liar everything you do is sin
Liar nobody believes you
Liar they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
So now you know you could be dead before they let you, uh
