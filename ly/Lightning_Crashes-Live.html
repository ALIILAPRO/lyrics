		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lightning crashes a new mother cries
Her placenta falls to the floor
The angel opens her eyes
The confusion sets in
Before the doctor can even close the door

Lightning crashes an old mother dies
Her intentions fall to the floor
The angel closes her eyes
The confusion that was hers
Belongs now to the baby down the hall

Oh now feel it, coming back again
Like a rolling, thunder chasing the wind
Forces pulling from
The center of the earth again
I can feel it

Lightning crashes a new mother cries
This moment she's been waiting for
The angel opens her eyes
Pale blue colored iris
Presents the circle
Puts the glory out to hide, hide

Oh now feel it, coming back again
Like a rolling, thunder chasing the wind
Forces pulling from
The center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it

Oh, I
Oh, I
Oh, I

I can feel it, coming back again
Like a rolling, thunder chasing the wind
Forces pulling from
The center of the earth again
I can feel it

I can feel it, coming back again
Like a rolling, thunder chasing the wind
Forces pulling from
The center of the earth again
I can feel it

I can feel it, coming back again
Like a rolling, thunder chasing the wind
Forces pulling from
The center of the earth again
I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it
