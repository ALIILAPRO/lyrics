		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used to do
Girl, I'm open to anything that'll get you into that zone
And understand that we're all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl, you know what's in store

Baby I will stay up all night
I've been goin' hard since last night
And I'ma go harder tonight
Wish you could see you through my eyes
Oh, I'm telling you this ain't the same
And I know he's still in your brain
I'm 'bout to burn that shit into flames
Once I'm in you, baby whoa

Forget what you know (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Make yourself at home (ooh)
'Cause baby when I'm finished with ya
You won't wanna go outside

Whoa
Whoa
Yeah

And I'ma work you like a pro, baby, why
And, you gon' take it like one
Yeah, you gon' take it like one
And I'ma give it like you asked for it, why
'Cause you been talkin' 'bout it
I know you talkin' 'bout it
Ooh baby, when I'm done with you, why
You ain't saying nothing
Yeah, you ain't saying nothing
Ooh baby, when I'm done with you, why
You ain't saying nothing
Yeah, you ain't saying nothing
You gon' make me show off
All the pain that you feel, you can tell
That we ain't making no love
But I'll pretend, oh girl, I'll pretend
If you pretend, then girl, I'll pretend
Let's make it seem like we're all we need in the end

Whoa, whoa

Forget what you know
Make yourself at home (whoa)
'Cause baby when I'm finished with ya
You won't wanna go outside

Yeah, whoa, whoa
Oh yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, let's break it down

La la la la
La la la la la la la, ah, la, don't
Go outside
Go outside ooh
Ay, ooh
Let's break it down

La la la la
La la la la la la la
Yeah
Go outside
Baby go outside
Baby go outside
