		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still, I call it magic when I'm next to you

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious truth

And I don't, and I don't, and I don't, and I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
No, I don't, it's true
I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it ma-ma-ma-magic

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Oh yes, I do
Of course, I do
