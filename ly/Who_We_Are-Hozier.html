		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has a cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers, love
Falling from you drop by drop

What I had left here
I just held it tight
So someone with your eyes
Might come in time
To hold me like water
Or Christ, hold me like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You and I burned out our steam
Chasing someone else's dream
How can something be so much heavier
But so much less than what it seems?
Darling, we sacrificed
We gave our time to something undefined
This phantom life
Sharpens like an image
But it sharpens like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has its cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers, love
Falling from you drop by drop
