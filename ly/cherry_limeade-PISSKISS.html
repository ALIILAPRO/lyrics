		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't escape the heat
Even melted my CD's
Can't get no sleep on trampolines

Our favorite haunts
Were just chain restaurants
But that was then and this is now

We made it through with what we had
And I had you

I miss pink skies
The light has left my eyes
For you
I'd even drive through a monsoon

I held you through
The first worst thing
You'd been through
But that was then and this is now

We made it through with what we had
And I had you

We made it through with what we had
And I had you

No AC on
Windows down
Put White Teeth Teens on
You never asked to skip the song

We made it through with what we had
And I had you
We made it through with what we had
And I had you
We made it through with what we had
And I had you
We made it through with what we had
And I had you
