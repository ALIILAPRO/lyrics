		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another, you been messin' around
They say you got a boyfriend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you and it's bringin' me down
But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheap when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line
But I'm tellin' you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is, keep this in mind

You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun, so you take it on the run

You're thinkin' up your white lies
You're puttin' on your bedroom eyes
You say you're comin' home but you won't say when
But I can feel it comin'
If you leave tonight, keep runnin'
And you need never look back again

You take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun, so you take it on the run

Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun, so you take it on the run
Take it on the run, baby
If that's the way you want it, baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun, so you take it on the run

Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another, you been messin' around
