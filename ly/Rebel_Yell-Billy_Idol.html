		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
Last night a little angel came pumpin' on my floor
She said, "Come on baby I got a license for love
And if it expires pray help from above" because

In the midnight hour she cried, "More, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried, "More, more, more", oh
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more
More, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to me babe?
What set you free? I need you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried, "More, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried, "More, more, more", oh
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more

He lives in his own Heaven
Collects it to go from the 7-11
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just as long, just as long it don't mess up his hair

Whoa, oh

I walked the world with you, babe (babe)
A thousand miles with you (with you)
I dried your tears of pain (pain), babe (babe)
A million times for you (for you)

I'd sell my soul (soul) for you babe (babe)
For money to burn (burn) with you (with you)
I'd give you all, and have none, babe (babe)
Justa, justa, justa, justa, to have you here by me (here by me)
Because

In the midnight hour she cried, "More, more, more"
With a rebel yell she cried, "More, more, more", oh
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried, "More, more, more"
More, more, more

Ooh yeah little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more, more

Ooh yeah little angel
She want more
More, more, more, more, more
