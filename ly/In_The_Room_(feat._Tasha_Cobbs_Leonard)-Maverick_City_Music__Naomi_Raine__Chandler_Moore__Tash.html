		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:
I'm not forsaken
Never alone
The God of Heaven 
Calls me His own 
He's not just seated upon the throne 
I know He's right here inside my home

Verse 2:
I've got a treasure 
Here in my heart 
And in my weakness
It won't depart
I have a Savior who will abide
He's not just with me, He lives inside 

Pre chorus: 
Just go ask Daniel if 
our God will bring you out 
And he will testify 
He shuts the Lion's mouth
Go ask those Hebrew boys 
if He'll stick by your side
They will identify 
the fourth man in the fire (they'll tell you)

Chorus:
Ohhhhhhhhhhh
He's in the room

Verse 2:
I've got a treasure 
Here in my heart 
And in my weakness
It won't depart
I have a Savior who will abide
He's not just with me He lives inside 

Prechorus: 
Just go ask Daniel if 
our God will bring you out 
And he will testify 
He shuts the Lion's mouth'

Go ask those Hebrew boys 
if He'll stick by your side
They will identify 
the fourth man in the fire (they'll tell you)

Bridge:
If I search the heavens high 
He's there 
If I search the earth below
He's there 
If I make my bed in hell 
He's there 
No matter where I go
He's there 

Where can I run from His Spirit
He's there 
Where can I go from His presence
He's there 
Even in the deepest depths 
He's there 
No matter where I go
He's there 


Vamp:
I'm never alone
He'll never forsake me
I'll stay in His arms 
Right here in His safety
