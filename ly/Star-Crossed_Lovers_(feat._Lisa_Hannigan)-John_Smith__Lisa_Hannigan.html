		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We star-crossed lovers rarely have the chance
To hang out underneath the moon and dance
Would you permit me now to fill your glass
And take a walk, maybe a second chance?

Let's tell each other of the things we've seen
It's been a crazy year, where do I begin?
Would you allow me to confess my sins
And take me gently, for the state I'm in?

Please remember me 
I'm not invisible
Oh, when no-one is watching
We could be star-crossed lovers again

We've been together for a million years
We play the same old hand of hopes and fears
Would you forgive me if I spilled the beans
And told you what goes on behind the scenes?

I've been a mess but now I'm being brave 
It all got heavy and I'm trying not to cave
Would you be fine with me just being scared?
The clouds are out tonight, let's strip them bare

Please remember me 
I'm not invisible
It's not impossible
Oh, when no-one is watching
We could be star-crossed lovers again
