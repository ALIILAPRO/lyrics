		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You never take advice
Some day, you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time (ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You want paradise
But, some day, you'll pay the price
I know

I've seen it before, it happens all the time (ooh-ooh)
You're closing the door, you leave the world behind
You're digging for gold, you're throwing away (ah, ah)
A fortune in feelings but, some day, you'll pay

Cold as ice
You know that you are
Cold as ice
As cold as ice to me
Cold as ice

Ooh, ooh, ooh, cold as, cold as ice
You're as cold as ice
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, yes, I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes, I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice, I know
You're as cold as ice, oh, yes, I know
You're as cold as ice, cold as ice
