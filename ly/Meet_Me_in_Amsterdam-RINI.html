		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would sail across the world
Row this boat from dusk till dawn
To a place where we belong
Girl your body is calling me

There ain’t no sunshine, no sunshine
Where I was before
But I found the Love the warmth in your arms

Won’t you come closer, let it take over
I don’t need anything, I just want you

When I saw her in my dreams
Never thought it meant a thing
Till I felt and touched her skin
When she smiles, my knees go weak

There ain’t no sunshine, no sunshine
Where I was before
But I found the Love the warmth in your arms

Won’t you come closer, let it take over
I don’t need anything, I just want you

If there is a next time
If there is a next time meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam

Meet me in Amsterdam meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam meet me in Amsterdam

Meet me in Amsterdam meet me in Amsterdam
Meet me in Amsterdam meet me in Amsterdam
