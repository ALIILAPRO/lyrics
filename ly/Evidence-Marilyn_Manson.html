		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have eyes that lead me on
And a body that shows me death
Your lips look like they were made
For something else, but they just suck my breath
I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed
And I know you're not just what you say to me
And I'm not the only moment you're made of

[Chorus:]
You're so sudden and sweet on your legs, knockin' knees
Head's blown clean off, your mouth paid off
Fuck me till we know it's unsafe
And we'll paint over the evidence

Want you wanting me
Want what I see in your eyes
So give me something to be scared of
Don't give me something to satisfy

[Chorus]

I want your pain to taste why you're ashamed
And I know you're not just what you say to me
And I'm not the only moment you're made of

[Chorus x 2]
