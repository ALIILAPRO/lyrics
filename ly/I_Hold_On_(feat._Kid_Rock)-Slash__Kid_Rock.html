		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel your comfort in my dreams
Unprotected silent screams
Light beyond your shadow beams
Still I don't know what it means

When seasons change
Memories remain

I hold on cause I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on cause I cant' let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on

And when the darkness turns today
I won't let you drift away
Conscience fades and some let go
But I hang on cause I know

When seasons change
Memories remain

I hold on cause I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on cause I cant' let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on

I hold on cause I won't let go
Even though I know there's solitude below
I hold on cause I cant' let go
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold

No, no
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on
I hold on
I refuse to let the hands of fate unfold
I hold on
