		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be fooled by the whispers of the winds from the North
They'll just leave you where you lay, broken, beaten on the floor
My dear baby, these words are pouring straight from the Lord
You've got a diamond, I got gold, do we really need much more?

Don't be fooled by the voices that we're hearing from the town
'Cause all that matters in the end is that we're famous in this house
Open up all the walls, let the wind just blow us out
Take us away to a place where we couldn't live without

Well then, just take my hand and be with me, my dear
We'll stay for good
Well then, just promise me a life that's green from leaves
Beneath oak trees, here, beneath oak trees

Don't you know of the road that never has an end
Cross over lines, smell the pines from the places we have been
Stand here now and just know that these words will never change
And put your palms into mine so our hearts can beat the same

Well then, just take my hand and be with me, my dear
We'll stay for good
Well then, just promise me a life that's green from leaves
Beneath oak trees, here, beneath oak trees, oh

When we grow old, we'll find love in every single place
I'll put your flowers in a pitcher 'cause I can't find a vase
But for now, sit with me at the altar of our grace
The sky looks pretty but I swear to you, it's jealous of your face

Well then, just take my hand and be with me, my dear
We'll stay for good
Well then, just promise me a life that's green from leaves
Beneath oak trees, here, beneath oak trees
