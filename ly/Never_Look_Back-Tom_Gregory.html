		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should we let our heart break while we wait for the moment
And hold on 'til we see where it's goin'?
God knows, you and I could be golden
No, I'll never look back, no, I'll never look back

(One, two, three, four)

Super soul, chemicals, back and forth
Never know you needed me
Runnin' fast down the hill, lose control
Fall until you know, you know, you know

I wanna reach out to your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
Yeah, I wanna reach out to your love
(Your love, your love, your love)

Should we let our heart break while we wait for the moment
And hold on 'til we see where it's goin'?
God knows, you and I could be golden
No, I'll never look back, no, I'll never look back

No, I'll never look back, no, I'll never look back
No, I'll never look back

Beautiful antidote
Pushin' life through my bones, slowly
Lightning bolt flashin' by
You and I, neon sky, and now I know, I know

And I gotta reach out to your love
(Your love, your love, your love)
And I wanna reach out to your love
(Oh-oh, your love, oh-oh, your love, oh-oh, your love)

Should we let our heart break while we wait for the moment
And hold on 'til we see where it's goin'?
God knows, you and I could be golden
No, I'll never look back
Should we let our heart break while we wait for the moment
And hold on 'til we see where it's goin'? (See where it's goin')
God knows, you and I could be golden (I could be golden)
No, I'll never look back, no, I'll never look back

Show me somethin', show me somethin'
Show me somethin', oh, oh, oh, oh
Show me somethin', show me somethin'
No, we'll never look back, no, we'll never look back
