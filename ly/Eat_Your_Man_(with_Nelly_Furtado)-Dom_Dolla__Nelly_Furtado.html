		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, ah, oh

I'll eat your man, devour him whole
Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control
Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home
Movin' my body like a nympho
I say it right, now do what I say
Apply the pressure into your veins
Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain
I let the creatures out of the cage

Ah, ah, oh
I let the creatures out of the cage
(I'll eat your man, devour him whole)
(Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control)
(Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home)
Ah, ah, oh (movin' my body like a nympho)
(I say it right, now do what I say)
(Apply the pressure into your veins)
(Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain)
Ah, ah, oh (I let the creatures out of the cage)

I'll eat your man, devour him whole
Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control
Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home
Movin' my body like a nympho
I say it right, now do what I say
Apply the pressure into your veins
Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain
I let the creatures out of the cage
I'll eat your man, devour him whole
Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control
Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home
Movin' my body like a nympho
I say it right, now do what I say
Apply the pressure into your veins
Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain
I let the creatures out of the cage

Ah, ah, oh
I let the creatures out of the cage
Ah, ah, oh
I let the creatures out of the cage
(I'll eat your man, devour him whole)
(Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control)
(Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home)
Ah, ah, oh (movin' my body like a nympho)
(I say it right, now do what I say)
(Apply the pressure into your veins)
(Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain)
(I let the creatures out of the cage)

(I'll eat your man, devour him whole)
(Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control)
(Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home)
Ah, ah, oh (movin' my body like a nympho)
(I say it right, now do what I say)
(Apply the pressure into your veins)
(Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain)
Ah, ah, oh (I let the creatures out of the cage)

I'll eat your man, devour him whole
Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control
Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home
Movin' my body like a nympho
I say it right, now do what I say
Apply the pressure into your veins
Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain
I let the creatures out of the cage
I'll eat your man, devour him whole
Lickin' my fingers, I'm in control
Fly like a bird, I'm takin' it home
Movin' my body like a nympho
I say it right, now do what I say
Apply the pressure into your veins
Blood on the floor, I'm pushin' the pain
I let the creatures out of the cage
