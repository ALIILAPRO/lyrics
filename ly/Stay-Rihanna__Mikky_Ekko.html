		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All along it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, and said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Well, funny you're the broken one 
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light 
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay
I want you to stay
Ooh
