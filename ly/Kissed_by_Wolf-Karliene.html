		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kings of sea
Water steeds
Burn with fire
Songs of war
Upon the lyre

Life is war
Clash of swords
Rest assured
Scars are trophies
Kissed by wolf

(Kissed by wolf )
We fight with the one called wolf-kissed
(Kissed by wolf )
The one with the sight of Odin
(Kissed by wolf )
We know that every scar
(Kissed by wolf )
Is revered in Valhalla 

Mighty roars 
Echo o'er
Veils of time
And evermore
The raven flies

Life is war
Clash of swords 
Rest assured
Scars are trophies
Kissed by wolf

(Kissed by wolf )
We fight with the one called wolf-kissed
(Kissed by wolf )
The one with the sight of Odin
(Kissed by wolf )
We know that every scar
(Kissed by wolf )
Is revered in Valhalla
