		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three and four and
Ba, ba, da
Ba, ba, da, ba, da, da
Mmm

My boy's being sus, he was shady enough
But now he's just a shadow
My boy loves his friends like I love my split ends
And by that I mean
He cuts 'em off
(What?)

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised

My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

My boy's being sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father (who are you?)
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar 
And by that I mean he said he'd change

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised

My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

My boy, my, my boy, my friends
I love, love, I, I love, love my split ends

My boy
My, my boy, my boy
(Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love)
(Alright dude, go trip over a knife)

My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

You want me to be yours, well, then you gotta be mine 
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
You want me to be yours, well, then you gotta be mine
And if you want a good girl, then goodbye
