		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me, baby
Do you still feel the way you did?
'Cause I can't tell, baby
No, I can't tell what's in your head
But I don't know where to turn
But if you wanna' change your mind
I'll take you and we'll run

Black magic, come on
Just let me on now, I believe
Black magic, come on

You know it's crazy, baby
How I still see you in my sleep
And I can't shift the way you're always on my mind, mind
But I don't know where to turn
But if you wanna' change your mind
I'll take you and we'll run

Black magic, come on
Just let me on now I believe
Black magic, come on

Don't you let me at all
When I've given all I've got to give
Black magic, come on

Do you still feel the way you did?
Do you still feel the way you did?
