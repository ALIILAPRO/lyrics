		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spent my nights
On melting snow
Just turning my sorrows into pure gold
And I laugh inside
'Cause you won't know
I was here from the moment the lights showed

Oh, bless my heart
When the wolves take me away
Don't fall apart
When I come back from the grave
Forget my charms
I'll never be the same
We've came so far
Only to drift away

Oh, bless my heart
When the wolves take me away
Don't fall apart
When I come back from the grave
Forget my charms
I'll never be the same
We've came so far
Only to go insane

Insane
No one will notice (ooh-ooh)
I'm sane
Insane

Stay by my side
When the nightmare goes
I've been feeling distant
Just way out of control

But I laugh inside
Just so you can glow in the dark
When it's time for me
So just stay

Why don't you wanna stay?
You just wanna trip me out
Why don't you wanna stay?

Oh, bless my heart
When the wolves take me away
Don't fall apart
When I come back from the grave
Forget my charms
I'll never be the same
We've came so far
Only to go insane

Insane
No one will notice (ooh-ooh)
I'm sane
Insane

I'm sane

Can't see

I'm sane
Umm, umm, umm, umm
Umm, umm, umm, umm

I waited endlessly all night
Looking up at all the fireflies in the skies
I made it carefully to your side
That's when the lights turned on and you were just a lie

I'm sane
I'm sane
