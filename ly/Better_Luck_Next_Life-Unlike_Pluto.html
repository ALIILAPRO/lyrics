		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of nowhere hallway walls are breathing
Something leads to nothing in the end 
Is it fate or fortune nobody knows
A series of unfortunate events

Better luck next life 
So Saddle up and ride to
Anywhere, Anywhere 

Better luck next life
So Saddle up and ride to 
Anywhere, Anywhere

Opening my mind, please come and visit
If you made it in you’d go insane
Eons overthinking in an instant
Suddenly you’re back where you began

Better luck next life
So Saddle up and ride to
Anywhere, Anywhere

Too late, close the book on better days
New age, try to reincarnate
Quit the ending, Quit the race, make a new home evacuate 
It’s too late, better luck next, life
