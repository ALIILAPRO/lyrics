		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been up late for with aggression 
Trying to find me in another question 
Calm faced never showed depth in me 
No trust fund so I trust in me yeah 

I been searching for a blessing 
I been searching for a blessing

Too much on my conscience 
God sent 
But I know that I would die for it 
I need some bread just to break off 
But I got to stay alive for it 

They can’t hang me out
to dry like some socks 
I been stepping for a plot 
Make a movie on the spot 
If it’s messy find the goal 
I been switching up the tone 
like I’m switching pick and rolls 
Now I’m boxing out the box in my zone

I been searching for a blessing 
I been searching for a blessing

Leave it all behind 6 o clock let the time go
She say what’s up I ignore cuz my heart cold 
Fake on my line hit the block like a light pole 
I’m on the rise tryna reach another time zone 

Stressing 
Blessings 
weapon 
By my side 

Holstered 
anger
Need some
peace of mind 

Keep a anchor 
ship can’t
Capsize 

Searching for truth 

I been searching for a blessing 
I been searching for a blessing
I been searching for a blessing 
I been searching for a blessing

I been searching for a blessing 
I been searching for a blessing
