		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel I'm out of senses
There's a power in the air
Tastes like summer's ending
Tastes like 20 with no care
If I die too soon
Does it matter what I do
If I live too fast
Will I ever make it back
I push a little push a little
Push a little
Kicking
Don't wanna think about
The things they say I could be missing
I push a little push a little
I'm a little on a landslide
Tripping into paradise
When we're kissing
I push a little push a little
Push a little
Kicking
Don't wanna think about
The things they say I could be missing
I push a little push a little
I'm a little on a landslide
Tripping into paradise
When we're kissing
Turn off the TV
It's showing me my life
Rather fall and land on my knees
If I bleed then it means I'm alive
Don't get caught in the wind as it shakes
Or the memories of all our mistakes
We'll make a movie and pick all the better takes
If I die too soon
Does it matter what I do
If I live too fast
Will I ever make it back
So I
I push a little push a little
Push a little
Kicking
Don't wanna think about
The things they say I could be missing
I push a little push a little
I'm a little on a landslide
Tripping into paradise
When we're kissing
I push a little push a little
Push a little
Kicking
Don't wanna think about
The things they say I could be missing
I push a little push a little
I'm a little on a landslide
Tripping into paradise
When we're kissing
