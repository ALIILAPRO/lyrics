		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down by the banks a sunflower blooms
Reaching into the clouds
Ever young and ever growing
Defying the hardest winds' blowing

Time and again I have drawn her
Ever since she was a golden-haired girl
Taken up by devotion
I still hear her sing by the ocean

Oh, baby, don't you notice me, notice me?
So ready to lose everything 
Everything for your love

Every day I'm getting closer to you
But you never answer my song
I know love does not come easy
Oh, there must be someone who hears me

Oh, baby, don't you notice me, notice me?
So ready to lose everything, everything
Oh, baby, don't you notice me, notice me?
So ready to lose everything
Everything for your love

For your love
Your love

Now I water the ground in which she stands
And shield her from every storm
For if I don't we might go under
Forever bound asunder 
No God above who will wonder
What about us
