(I'm at, I'm at Suecos, bitch)

Fast, four hundred on the dash
Fifty five bills, buck fifty for the tax on the bag
I don't really like to brag
Vetements socks when I'm steppin' out of Sak's
I'ma hit in the morning 'cause I'm whiskey dickin'
Got my brother out in Cashville flippin' chickens
Free bro from the can I ain't talkin' Whippits
Bitch I make beats and bad decisions

You at Sueco's
Stop the bitchin'
I ain't really fuckin' with you if you ain't with the vision
First time she came through, pulled down my britches
I ain't spendin' no bread, but I'll pay her a visit
I'm at LIV goin' up, but you can't get in it
She want a hit, I'm rollin up, got that Popeye spinach
Told me that I'm a child, told her quit the kiddin'
I'ma pass it to my rell, let him hit the kitten

She a Vixen on the cam so I grab my iPhone
She dumb with the head got me doin' a eye roll
She bad on film, gotta check out the B roll
Put my D in her V got her singin' a C note

Fast, four hundred on the dash
Fifty five bills, buck fifty for the tax on the bag
I don't really like to brag
Vetements socks when I'm steppin' out of Sak's
I'ma hit in the morning 'cause I'm whiskey dickin'
Got my brother out in Cashville flippin' chickens
Free bro from the can I ain't talkin' Whippits
Bitch I make beats and bad decisions

You at Sueco's
Get with the program
Light skin bitch off that Lindsay Lohan
She off the dust
She off the Hillary Duff
Baby I ain't tryna cuff, I'm just tryna bust
Wait hol' up, you gotta play with my nuts, hmm
I'ma make a beat out your butt, hmm
007 James Bond
Double Oreo Stuffed
Double up my funds

She's a Vixen on the cam so I grab my iPhone
She dumb with the head got me doin' a eye roll
She bad on film, gotta check out the B roll
Put my D in her V got her singin' a C note

Fast, four hundred on the dash
Fifty five bills, buck fifty for the tax on the bag
I don't really like to brag
Vetements socks when I'm steppin' out of Sak's
I'ma hit in the morning 'cause I'm whiskey dickin'
Got my brother out in Cashville flippin' chickens
Free bro from the can I ain't talkin' Whippits
Bitch I make beats and bad decisions

(I'm at, I'm at Suecos, bitch)
