		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unchain my heart
Baby, let, let me be
'Cause you don't care
Well, please
Set me free

Unchain my heart
Baby, let me go
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't love me no more

Every time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home
Unchain my heart
Set me free

Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Baby, let me be
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
'Cause you don't care about me

You've got me sewed up like a pillow case
But you let my love go to waste
Unchain my heart
Set me free

I'm under your spell
Like a man in a trance baby
Oh, but you know darn well
That I don't stand a chance

Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Let me go my way
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
You worry me night and day

Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart, oh please
Set me free
Alright

I'm under your spell
Just like a man in a trance, baby
But you know darn well
That I don't stand a chance

Please unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
Let me go my way
Unchain my heart (unchain my heart)
You worry me night and day

Why lead me through a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
Unchain my heart
Please set me free

Oh, set me free
Oh, woman why don't you do that for me (unchain my heart)
You don't care
Won't you let me go (unchain my heart)
If you don't love me no more
Like a man in a trance (unchain my heart)

Unchain my heart)
Let me go
I'm under your spell (unchain my heart)
Like a man in a trance
And you know darn well (unchain my heart)
That I don't stand a chance, no
Oh (unchain my heart)

You don't care
Please set me free (unchain my heart)
