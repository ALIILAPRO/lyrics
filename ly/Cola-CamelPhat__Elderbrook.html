		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got ready for the night and
She's heading for the lights
She sees the vision going
Copping line after line
See how she looks for trouble
See how she dances and
She sips a Coca-Cola
She can't tell the difference yet

That's what you're coming for, but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You're askin' what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca-Cola
She can't tell the difference yet

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (she can't tell the difference yet)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (she can't tell the difference yet)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (she can't tell the difference yet)

That's what you're coming for, but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You're askin' what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca-Cola
She can't tell the difference yet

That's what you're coming for, but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You're askin' what's happening
It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca-Cola
She can't tell the difference yet

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh
Got ready for the night and
She's heading for the lights
She sees the vision going
Copping line after line

See how she looks for trouble
See how she dances and
She sips the Coca-Cola
She can't tell the difference and
She can't tell the difference and

Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 

That's what you're coming for, but
They don't want to let you in and
You drop your bag to the floor and
You're askin' what's happening

It's getting late now, hey now
Enough of the arguments
She sips the Coca-Cola
She can't tell the difference yet
