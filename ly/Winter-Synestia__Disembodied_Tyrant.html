		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The pale white sheet blankets the Earth
Smothering the fields of the Great War
Abounded by dulled swords and battered shields
Immortalized in the gore

Crimson snowfall
Suffocating fields of corpses
Lay dead, rotten, cold
A world reborn
Baptized and overwritten
Winter, the harbinger
The eternal cold has awoken
Bring the end of all, murderer of gods

A breeze pierces the roots of life
Poisoning all who oppose, now they shall fall
Time has come for the fighting to end
Only the warm call of demise beckons you forth

A mass extinction torn congruence
Countless granted from flesh
Behold, thy kingdom come

Mutually assured destruction
The final winter has begun to rise
Smell the putrid scent of death linger in the air
Hear the silent doom cast on thy remains

Keep clawing at the dirt above your head
For this is your tomb
Death encased in ice

Sunlight swallowed by these ashen clouds
The age to end all suffering
The gods of old lay gutted and dethroned

Cold has took their bones
Along with body and soul
The wretched dogs put down consequences infidel
Piercing pale white beams engulfing lunacy
A war-torn ageless plight
Enter dying night

Crimson snowfall
Suffocating fields of corpses
Lay dead, rotten, cold
A world reborn
Baptized and overwritten
Winter, the harbinger

Oh, this cold
Weary old world
