		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free (I do, I do)

I'm standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number too
I do keep a date with you

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
Free

I need an easy friend
I do, with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

I'll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can't see you every night
No, I can't see you every night
Free

I do
I do
I do
I do
