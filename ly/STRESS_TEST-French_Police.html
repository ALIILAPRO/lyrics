		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooh
Yeah
There's someone in your house
There's someone in your room
He's looking out your window
He's looking at you
And now you're out of time
He's got you in his arms
He's never letting go
So have a good night
Oooh
Yeah
There's someone in your house
There's someone in your room
He's looking out your window
He's looking at you
And now you're out of time
He's got you in his arms
He's never letting go
So have a good night
Oooh
Yeah
Have a good night
Have a good time
Talk a little bit
Talk a little shit
