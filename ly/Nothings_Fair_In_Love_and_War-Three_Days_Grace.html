		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always shoot first, never ask questions.
Never think of consequences.
I didn't feel a thing, I didn't feel a thing.
I never think twice, no intentions.
Never feel the consequences.
Until it starts to sting, until it starts to sting.
No, it never hurt like this before.
No, nothing's fair in love and war.

Turn out, the lights.
Nothing's fair in love and war.
It's too late, to lie.
Nothing's fair in love and war.
Your hand, my knife, your heart, my life.
There's no wrong, or right.
When nothing's fair in love and war.

I never back down, always in crisis.
Left to my own devices.
You never meant a thing, you never meant a thing.
No, it never hurt like this before.
No, nothing's fair in love and war.

Turn out, the lights.
Nothing's fair in love and war.
It's too late, to lie.
Nothing's fair in love and war.
Your hand, my knife, your heart, my life.
There's no wrong, or right.
When nothing's fair in love and war.

Turn out, the lights.
Nothing's fair in love and war.
It's too late, to lie.
Nothing's fair in love and war.
Your hand, my knife, your heart, my life.
There's no wrong, or right.
When nothing's fair in love and war.
