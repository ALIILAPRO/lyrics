		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be that suffering one numb not clever

Ms. "I'll see you never" late out on the street

I'll be there cross holding always under weather 

In that old dirty sweater that never fitted me

All tattered those stories don't matter much to me

All weathered those old letters don't matter much to me

Sick from the gutter but now I'm feeling better

So now I'll send your letter with crossed i's dotted t's

Lost in the moment your fear of me is tethered

To where I am and centered on when I swear I'm clean

All tattered those stories don't matter much to me

All weathered those old letters don't matter much to me
