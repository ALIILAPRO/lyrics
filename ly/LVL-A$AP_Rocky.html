		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Yeah, uh)
Clams Casino, nigga (A$AP)
A$AP (uh)

Mister pistol popper (uh)
Flocko locked and loaded (yeah)
Life's a bitch and she pussy pop, know why? 'Cause I got her open (alright)
That pussy soakin' (uh)
Fuck is you promotin' (uh)
Yeah, you claim you rage, you hatin' like you live in Oakland
All my rap town niggas with the roof back
Introduce you niggas to the new swag
Make you say a nigga blew up too fast
Fuck I'm 'posed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'posed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the juice back, get your popcorn
Juice snacks, it's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps
Look at all the niggas that I blew past
Hood by Air, to the durag
Nigga make way for the new jacks

(Yeah, uh, yeah, uh, uh, yeah, yeah, uh) 
Uh (uh)

It's mister pistol popper screamin' "Fuck a copper"
I just bought a crispy choppa finna fuck your block up, blocka (yeah)
Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hatin' (yeah)
I been impatiently waitin' to show you niggas Satan (yeah)
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me (uh)
Bitch I'm trill-maluminati and got my crew behind me (alright)
Shooters round me (yeah)
Keep them looters round me (uh)
Keep a tool around me (uh)
It'll keep you fools from 'round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
Wit' a gat, wit a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat
Better back back, on a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass dat, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks, wit a ass, finna smash that
Make her catch that, A$AP then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, "Where the cash at?

Uh, I see dead people (uh)
I need dead people (uh)
Lord Pretty Flacko, bitch, I behead people (uh)
Kneel and kiss the ring (yeah)
All hail the king (all hail the king) (yeah)
Long live A$AP put that on everything (everything, everything)

(Alright mothafucka)
(Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, A$AP, yeah)
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
