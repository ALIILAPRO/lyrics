		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah don't gimme that (Don't gimme that)
Don't gimme that (Don't gimme that)
Don't gimme that

Take my body, take my soul
But don't take my rock n roll
Don't you dare, I'll see red
Hold your tongue but don't gimme that

Take my money, take my car
Don't you take my guitar
It won't play with you
Hoochie Koo, screw you

Don't gimme that
Oh baby you can take everything
It don't mean a thing
Anything to me
Don't gimme that
But don't control my rock n roll
No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Shut your head, hey baby don't gimme that

But don't gimme that

Well give me double trouble, heartache and pain
I'll take the blame but don't gimme that (But don't gimme that)
Lock me up, put me in chains
Ain't too bad but don't gimme that (Don't gimme that)

Do whatever you wanna do to me
You can not steal my esprit
You're barking up the wrong tree

Don't gimme that
Oh baby you can take everything
It don't mean a thing
Anything to me
But don't gimme that
But don't control my rock n roll
No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Shut your head, hey baby don't gimme that

But don't gimme that

But don't gimme that (No, no)
Let me breathe (Don't gimme that)
I want another survival
I won't give up my dreams
You cannot break my wings (oh no)
Baby, I'm a survivor
So don't gimme that

But don't gimme that

But don't gimme that
Oh baby you can take everything
It don't mean a thing
Anything to me
Don't gimme that
But don't control my rock n roll
No, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Shut your head, hey baby don't gimme that

But don't gimme that

But don't gimme that

But don't gimme that
