		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sky's fading blue
Sun dipping below the roof
I see the city, wonder if it's holding you

Two falls ago
I made you my home
And now I'm just trying to get better at being alone

Baby, on our best nights
I was there to hold your hand
And even on my worst nights
You were there to hold my hair
Trust me, I'd be lying
If I said I didn't think about you
'Cause now you got a new girl
And all I got is silver cowboy boots

Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you

Saw that you were with your friends in Colorado
I've been working overtime and drinking out the bottle
I wish I could forget everything
Baby, on our best nights
I was there to hold your hand
And even on my worst nights
You were there to hold my hair
Trust me, I'd be lying
If I said I didn't think about you
'Cause now you got a new girl
And all I got is silver cowboy boots

Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
Spent all my money on these Fendi boots
'Cause it stopped me from thinking about you
