		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
There's some things I can't help learnin'
At times man they make me feel selfish
At times man they make me real nervous
But that made me a real person
Anything suss I'm allergic
I grew up in the hood I deserve it
Pay me for my name, tryin to maintain
What a shame when the day ain't perfect
I'm a slave on the modern ship
Nba, NFL, not on politics
Got bored on 'em, got awards on 'em
Now a days they're treating music like tourism
What is pop, what is not?
What is different when you're not?
Still I'm grippin on the knot
Paranoid when I'm counting every dolla 
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised when you're black
(Should I say)
Anybody going through it like I did, skin color hybrid
One false move sending bullets through your cartilage
12 circle block, with the steel round where I live
Body get a nine for the slop
Gotta figure out to add time to the clock
Tick tick tock, tick tick tock
Load the mack, brrt, back when this shit finna drop

My, oh my, I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I'm just tryna live my life (that life)
All we know is sacrifice
My, oh my (oh my), I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I just want to make it right (make it right)
'Til we reach the afterlife

My, oh my (oh my), I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I'm just tryna live my life (my life)
All we know is sacrifice (sacrifice)
My, oh my (oh my), I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I just want to make it right (make it right)
'Til we reach the afterlife

Ironic how they wet you up when you drip too much
Acid, acid, say I trip too much
Talk a lot of shit, give lip too much
Exposure, showing how I live too much
Heart on my sleeve think I give too much
Outlaw, shooting from the hip too much
Wild boy, never shuck and jive for money
High boy, meet me in the clouds or something
Crowd roar, Mosh pits, thousands rumble
About four face facts this our humble
If the world was mine, I would watch it crumble
Toxic mind, I get in lots of trouble
Bartender please give me double
Gin on the rocks, I sin a lot
But that's okay, it Ben-o-fats
I swear I got more facts

My, oh my, I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I'm just tryna live my life (that life)
All we know is sacrifice
My, oh my (oh my), I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I just want to make it right (make it right)
'Til we reach the afterlife

My, oh my (oh my), I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I'm just tryna live my life (my life)
All we know is sacrifice (sacrifice)
My, oh my (oh my), I'm just tryna catch the vibe (that vibe)
I just want to make it right (make it right)
'Til we reach the afterlife
