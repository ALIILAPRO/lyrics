		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All winter we got carried away
Over on the rooftops, let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
And don't worry

Try
Try
Try
Try

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends

No, I don't want to battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow Death and all of his friends

And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape
And, in the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape
