		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Enrique, Usher
This is for the dirty girls
All around the world
Here we go

Dirty dirty dancer, uh

'Nother day, 'nother night
And she acting like she don't sleep
She's a five when she drinks
But she's a ten when she's on top of me

She don't want love she just wanna touch
She's a greedy girl to never get enough
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's got all the moves that make you get it up

She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only

She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Never ever lonely
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only (yeah)

It's a game, ah
That she plays
She can win with her eyes closed
It's insane how she tames
She can turn you to an animal, yeah, yeah, yeah

She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's a greedy girl to never get enough
She don't wanna love she just wanna touch
She's got all the moves to make you give it up (yeah, yeah)

She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Never ever lonely (dirty dancer)
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only (oh no)

She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Never ever lonely (never ever lonely)
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only (never be her only)

She never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you're lonely

No, she's never satisfied
You better do it right
Before you're lonely

C'mon
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Never ever lonely (never ever lonely)
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only (never be her only)

She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
Never ever lonely (no, no, no)
She's a dirty dirty dancer, dirty dirty dancer
You'll never be her only
You'll never be her only

The girl don't stop (oh, oh, oh)
Dirty dancer
The girl don't stop (oh, oh)
The girl don't stop (oh, oh)
Dirty dancer

The girl don't stop (oh, oh)
The girl don't stop (oh, oh)
Dirty dancer

The girl don't stop (oh, oh)
The girl don't stop (oh)
