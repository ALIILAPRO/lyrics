Woulda to go peepin' 'round the moun this is little go bad to prime

Load on my back wit' the quick year back to be to be get fucked see
Bring yo' Mustang, star wanna be a mother put this gas up on the trip overri-

Got up, where you, get you, got, up, where you, get you, got, up
Where you, get you, now, go, up, where you, now

Got up, where you, get you, got, up, where you, get you, got, up
Where you, get you, now, go, up, where you, now, got up
Where you, get you, got, up, where you, get you, got, up

Bring yo' Mustang, star wanna be a mother put this gas up on the trip override that
Got up, where you, get you, got, up, where you, get that up now
