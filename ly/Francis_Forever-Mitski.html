		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what to do without you 
I don't know where to put my hands 
I've been trying to lay my head down 
But I'm writing this at three AM 

I don't need the world to see 
That I've been the best I can be, but 
I don't think I could stand to be 
Where you don't see me 

On sunny days I go out walking 
I end up on a tree-lined street 
I look up at the gaps of sunlight 
I miss you more than anything 

I don't need the world to see 
That I've been the best I can be, but 
I don't think I could stand to be 
Where you don't see me 

And autumn comes when you're not yet done 
With the summer passing by, but 
I don't think I could stand to be 
Where you don't see me
