		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A flower lady's daughter
As sweet as holy water
Said, "I'm the school reporter
Please teach me", well I taught her

Two fingered levi'd sister
Said, "Peace", I stopped I kissed her
Said, "I'm a male resister"
I smiled and just unzipped her

High diving Chinese trender
Black hair and black suspender
Said, "Please me no surrender
Just love to feel your Fender"

All of you know that the girls of the road
Are like apples you stole in your youth
All of you know that the girls of the road
Been around but are versed in the truth

Stone-headed Frisco spacer
Ate all the meat I gave her
Said would I like to taste hers
And even craved the flavor

"Like marron-glaced fish bones
Oh lady hit the road!"

All of you know that the girls of the road
Are like apples you stole in your youth
All of you know that the girls of the road
Been around but are versed in the truth
