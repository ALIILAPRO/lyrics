		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frame by frame (suddenly)
Death by drowning (from within)
In your own, in your own analysis

Step by step (suddenly)
Doubt by numbers (from within)
In your own, in your own analysis

Frame by frame (suddenly)
Death by drowning (from within)
In your own, in your own analysis

Step by step (suddenly)
Doubt by numbers (from within)
In your own, in your own, in your own analysis
