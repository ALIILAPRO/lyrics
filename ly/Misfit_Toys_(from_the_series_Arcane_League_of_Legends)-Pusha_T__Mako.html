		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I declare war
On anybody standing in the way of what I dream for
How could you ignore
The ones that are voiceless, screams from the poor?
They only here to score
I do it for the underground kings that'll need more
I'm kickin' down your door
If I wonder why you got a pocket full of green for (rrah)
It's all about the get back
It's hard to give back while the politicians kick back
They say I'm only brick rap
Well, that's the foundation of this mountain that I live at
I can get you kidnapped
These kids ain't playin' with you, actin' like you live rap
And all those little mishaps
That only happen to you, misfits, I'm here to fix that (yeah)

Time to dig up your grave
Make you lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this gang
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Rich get richer while the poor pickpocket
Swipes Maxwell 'til the cops come knockin'
Have or have not, bein' broke is not an option
Time after time when you got a thing for watches (ha)
When you the plug in the socket (yes)
And the powers that be can't stop it
So obnoxious, borderline toxic
Both sides go to war like a mosh pit (yeah)
Now let me switch up the optics
Our neighborhoods held us hostage (that's real)
Some nights we slept in our closets (that's real)
Gun fights was outside the projects (brrah)
So you can't blame me for nonsense
I'm here to collect deposits
All else defies the logic
My people need me beside them (now)

Time to dig up your grave
Make you lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this gang
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Don't play with the misfits
Come play with the misfits
Don't play with the misfits
Come and play with the misfits

I told you don't play with the misfits
Must be deaf, dumb and blind, you a triplet (triplet)
Don't you make me erase your existence
All by my lonely, need no assistance
Any disrespect gets met with a vengeance
Burn down gossip and hidden agendas
We set the tone for all to remember
You rewrite history, the greatest pretenders
(You rewrite history, the greatest pretenders, brrah)

Time to dig up your grave
Make you lower your voice
I told you not to play with the misfit toys
We running this gang
Getting sick of your noise
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys

Don't play with the misfits (brrah)
Come play with the misfits (yes)
You stranded with a bad bunch of misfit toys
