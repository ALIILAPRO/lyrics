		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nevada!
Mark Morrison!

Well, I tried to tell you so 
Yes, I did
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
'Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm real

You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me (oh my god, baby)
Dare I ask?

Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back

Return of the Mack

So, I'm back up in the game (hustling sound)
Running things to keep my swing (whole night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh, oh, oh)
So baby, listen carefully
While I sing my comeback song

(Squah!) you lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me (oh my god, baby)
Dare I ask?
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back

'Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
I had dreams of being up
And I ain't never leave you stuck (oh my god)
And you say you will never turn on me, baby, aye
You played me like a tournament, baby, aye
You know I gave you the best of me, baby
Oh man, I thought you were next to me, baby
I guess I gotta show you I am the one that you were with
That got you swerving in the whip
And putting diamonds on your wrists, baby
Still making hit after hit, baby
I bet you'll let me hit after this

You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

Return of the Mack, yea
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go
