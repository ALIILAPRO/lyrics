		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got me dancing and crying
Crowing and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river
Cold by the fever
Love don't let me go
Don't let me go!

You've got me dancing
You've got me dancing and crying
Crowing and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river
Cold by the fever
Love don't let me go

You've got me dancing and crying
Crowing and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river
Cold by the fever
Love don't let me go
Don't let me go!

Don't let me go!

Don't let me go!

Don't let me go!

Don't let me go!
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
Got me drownin' in a river
I was cold from my fever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Eh, hey, hey, hey
Dancing and crying
Dancing and crying
Dancing and crying
Hey!
Dancing and crying
Dancing and crying
Dancing and crying
Hey!

You've got me dancing and crying
Crowing and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river
Cold by the fever
Love don't let me go
Don't let me go!

You've got me dancing and crying
Rollin' and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drownin' in a river
Cold by the fever
Love don't let me go
Don't let me go!

Don't let me go

Don't let me go!

Don't let me go!
