		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Clicks, clicks, clicks, they'll do anything to get a few
Tick, tick, tick, that's the sound before my head explodes
Quit, quit, quit, look at you up on your pedestal
Quick, quick, quick, here the critics come, it's time to go

I read your article, it kinda hurt me
I don't know who hired you
Or what your friends say in your circle
But the fact that you released it
Tells me two things are for certain
They get paid for trashing people
I get paid 'cause I stay working

Dropped 'The Search' and
They emerge up outta nowhere
To the surface, just to peep behind the curtain
Throwing salt at all my burdens
I'm aware I shouldn't give this my attention
Life's a journey, I should just stay on my path
And learn to laugh, you think they heard me?
Ears are burning, put 'em out
Quiet, quiet, look around
Why don't they find someone way more
Interesting to write about?
Us, we're kinda boring, aren't we?
All we do is whine and pout
It's confusing, so amusing
How I argue with myself

Hello
I spit it was ease so leave it to me
Doubted, but you better believe
I'm on a rampage, hit 'em, with the record release
Depending the week, I'm probably gonna have to achieve
Another goal, let me go and I'm over the beat
I go into beast mode like I'm ready to feast
I'm fed up with these thieves tryna get me to bleed
They wanna see me take an L, yep, see what I mean?
How many records I gotta give you to get with the program?
Take it for granted, I'm 'bout to give you the whole plan
Open your mind up and take a look at the blueprint
Debate if you gotta, but gotta hold it with both hands
Pick at the bars, you gotta be smart
You really gotta dig in your heart
If you wanna get to the root of an issue
Plus I'm in the middle, could be dark and be difficult
But they pay off at the end if it can help you to get to it, ayy

Paid my dues, made it through
Spread the news, I'm on the loose
Making moves, I need some room
Though he's cool, well, don't assume, don't assume, ayy

I'm the truth, oh, they want some proof? Here, don't be rude
Something new, even when I lose, I make it look cool
Do the show, then we hit the room, wife is looking, oh
What to do? I don't need the shades up to like the view

Yeah
It's time to get back in the swing of things
When my life crashes, I'm not the guy that'll flee the scene
I'll take ownership and own it and raise my hand if it's me
Just remember though, I'm only a man, I'm a human being
Don't the see, shoot the breeze I'd rather just stay discrete
People claim they're in your corner but leave you in times of need
They don't listen do they? (what?) They don't listen to anything
I'll accept advice if it's not presented ignorantly

Look, costs are high, they multiply
They cause divides and force the fight
The poison I been sipping on has quite the bite
It killed me twice, they rigged the lights
So y'all could see the parts of mine that aren't so bright
See, often I apologize and authorize the awful times
That pop up (Nate) like I'm right behind you
I'd advise you not to try and climb inside the mind like I do
Keep the rhyme book expedited, overnight it
Hold the tide in, hope the time is on my side
'Cause if it's not then I'll decide to override my own demise
I toe the line too close and I can improvise and empathize
But recognize the fact that I could jeopardize and wreck our lives
You better give me your attention, the undivided

Paid my dues, made it through
Spread the news, I'm on the loose
Making moves, I need some room
Though he's cool, well, don't assume, don't assume, ayy

Paid my dues, made it through
Spread the news, I'm on the loose
Making moves, I need some room
Though he's cool, well, don't assume, don't assume, ayy
