		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take away the sensation inside
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore

Drain the pressure from the swelling
The sensations overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing
So give me Novocaine

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling, that's alright
Jimmy says it's better than air,
I'll tell you why

Drain the pressure from the swelling
The sensations overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright 
Tell me that I won't feel a thing, 
So give me Novocaine

Oh Novocaine

Drain the pressure from the swelling, 
The sensations overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright,
Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing, 
So give me Novocaine

She's a rebel 
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth and she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante 
Missing link on the brink of destruction

From Chicago to Toronto 
She's the one that they call old whatsername

She's the symbol
Of resistance
And she's holding on my heart like a hand grenade

Is she dreaming
What I'm thinking
Is she the mother of all bombs gonna detonate

Is she trouble
Like I'm trouble
Make it a double twist of fate or a melody 

That she sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She sings the revolution
The dawning of our lives
She brings this liberation
That I just can't define
Nothing comes to mind

She's a rebel 
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth and she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante 
Missing link on the brink of destruction

She's a rebel 
She's a saint
She's salt of the earth and she's dangerous

She's a rebel
Vigilante 
Missing link on the brink of destruction

She's a rebel, she's a rebel, she's a rebel
And she's dangerous
She's a rebel, she's a rebel, she's a rebel
And she's dangerous
