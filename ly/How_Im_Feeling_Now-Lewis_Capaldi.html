		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you forgive me if I'm coming off a little bit obtuse?
Well, it's been a minute now since I have had to tell the truth
I know I can
I won't

Suppose I thought that by this moment I would have it figured out
But instead, I tend to spend my days consumed by seeds of doubt
I know I can
I won't

Oh, darling, it goes on and on and on
Always, forever, 'til I'm barely holding on
End of my tether and I know it won't be long
It won't be long 'til it's gone

So here's to my beautiful life
That seems to leave me so unsatisfied
No sense of self, but self-obsessed
I'm always trapped inside my fucking head

On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Said, "Thought I'd be happier somehow
If you were wondering how I'm feeling now"

I try to tell myself my best days are the ones that lie ahead
But I'm always looking back on things I wish I'd never said
I know I can
I won't

Oh, darling, it goes on and on and on
Always, forever, 'til I'm barely holding on
End of my tether and I know it won't be long
It won't be long 'til it's gone

So here's to my beautiful life
That seems to leave me so unsatisfied
No sense of self, but self-obsessed
I'm always trapped inside my fucking head

On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Said, "Thought I'd be happier somehow
If you were wondering how I'm feeling now"

I won't lie, I'm a mess, yeah
But I'll get there
No, I won't lie, I'm a mess, yeah
But I'll get there

So here's to my beautiful life
It seems to leave me so unsatisfied
No sense of self, but self-obsessed
I'm always trapped inside my fucking head

On and on and on, on and on and on
On and on and on, on and on and on
Said, "Thought I'd be happier somehow
If you were wondering how I'm feeling now"
