		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when the world got me going crazy
I'll carry on
And it's all because of you
Because of you

Remember when they told us
"You're not good enough"?
And then you came into my life
Yeah, you changing my world for good
(Yeah, woo)

Told me to love myself a bit harder than yesterday
Well, life is too short and we sure got to celebrate

And when the world got me going crazy
I carry on
'Cause I know I'm strong
When the world got me going crazy
I carry on
And it's all because of you
Because of you

Remember when they tried to break us?
Well, look at us now
You told me the right thing at the right time
You got me feeling wild
(Yeah, woo)

Now I love myself much more than I did yesterday
'Cause life is too short and we sure got to celebrate
Hey, yeah

And when the world got me going crazy
I carry on
'Cause I know I'm strong
When the world got me going crazy
I carry on
And it's all because of

I'll carry on despite of the things they said and done
They'll never kill this fire
Your love will take me higher
It's all because of you
Because of you
Well, because of you
Because of you I keep on going, baby
Baby, for a brighter day, yeah
(Yeah)

And when the world got me going crazy
(I carry on)
See, I carry on because of you
(World got me going crazy) oh
(I carry on) said I carry on
And when the world got me 
See, I will carry on
And it's all because of you
Because of you
Because of you
