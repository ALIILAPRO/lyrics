		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cll the leaves
Fallin from the trees
Rising up to find the air above
Suddenly
I could clearly see
So I said goodbye
To all the ones I've loved
So keep on coming around
To comfort me
Oh and find us
c place to land
cnd slow down
This restless man
Had my time
Spent it livin' off my mind
When all along
It's wrong that led the way
Found out long ago
No one ever knows
When to turn n go and when to stay
So keep on coming around
To comfort me
Oh and find us
c place to land
cnd slow down
This restless man
cin't saying I'll be the greatest
But I'd bet with all my soul
That this gamble on me baby
May be worth the roll
So keep on coming around
To comfort me
Oh and find us
c place to land
cnd slow down
This restless man
