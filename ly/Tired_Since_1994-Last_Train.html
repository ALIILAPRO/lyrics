		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trouble all around me.
Ahead and behind,
On my left, on my right,
That's all I can see.
I can take it one way or the other.
How could I think,
I could be something else,
Than a faded flower.

I've been tired since 1994.
Dried out and worn,
I can't remember how it feels to be bored.
I'm still dancing with pressure and fear.
Inmate from myself,
There's nothing I wish but to disappear.

I'm starting to fade away,
I'm too young to fade away,
No I just can't fade away !
