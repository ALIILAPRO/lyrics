		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, shit
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

No shit, I just quit, blew up quick, whoa
I just threw this temper tantrum, my new fit, whoa
No snitch, I get money, must admit, whoa
Yo' bitch work with me, submit, whoa
Kill the pussy, get away, acquit, whoa
Disappear, reappear, it's magic, whoa
Smokin' dope in the Rolls in traffic, whoa
Spillin' paint on my designer, it's tragic, whoa

Boy Meets World, you can be my Topanga
I don't wanna fall in love with a stranger
Boy Meets World, we got history like Feeny
Love you deeply, yeah, completely
Like a survey, baby, you complete me
Screamin', "Jordan, ballin' like a three-peat"
I'm important, she actin' like she need me
Girl, you're gorgeous, you could be on TV

No shit, I just quit, blew up quick, whoa
I just threw this temper tantrum, my new fit, whoa
No snitch, I get money, must admit, whoa
Yo' bitch work with me, submit, whoa
Kill the pussy, get away, acquit, whoa
Disappear, reappear, it's magic, whoa
Smokin' dope in the Rolls in traffic, whoa
Spillin' paint on my designer, it's tragic, whoa

I just wanna do it, I don't wear Adidas
Got shit movin' in like I need a Visa
Gotta get all this cheese like I ordered pizza
I don't chase no pussy, hell no, I'ma cheetah
I am a believer, I'm an overachiever
This is the procedure, don't want no more seizures
Wanted to be rich as a kid, my wrist the new freezer
Thumbin' through all these bands, that's a stress reliever

No shit, I just quit, blew up quick, whoa
I just threw this temper tantrum, my new fit, whoa
No snitch, I get money, must admit, whoa
Yo' bitch work with me, submit, whoa
Kill the pussy, get away, acquit, whoa
Disappear, reappear, it's magic, whoa
Smokin' dope in the Rolls in traffic, whoa
Spillin' paint on my designer, it's tragic, whoa

Damn Pi'erre, where'd you find this?

The number one rated mixtape of all time
