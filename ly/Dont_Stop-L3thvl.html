		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Them hips don't lie
The way you twerkin' it
Girl you look so fire
I'm like
Don't stop
Get it, Get it
Don't stop
Get it, Get it
Don't stop
Get it, Get it
Don't stop
Them hips don't lie
The way you twerkin' it
Girl you look so fire
I'm like
Don't stop
Get it, Get it
Don't stop
Get it, Get it
Don't stop
Get it, Get it
Don't stop
Do your dance
Do your, do your, do your dance
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Woop
Don't stop, get it, get it
She twerkin' for them bands
Yeah see bout' her business
Lights, camera, action
Shorty with it
She a baddie with a fatty
So I had to get it
Do your dance
NoNote in the building
Watch us throw them bands
I love the way she work it
Twerkin' with no hands
We make a movie
Then she put it on her OnlyFans
Cause them hips don't lie
See I had to get up on her
Had to grip them thighs
Haters keep lurkin
Tryna take what's mine
Slide in the DM
Get no reply
Work, work, work
Yeah she twerk, twerk, twerk
Yeah she do it, do it, do it
For the money
Yeah she work, work, work
Yeah she twerk, twerk, twerk
Yeah she do it, do it, do it
For the money
Them hips don't lie
The way you twerkin' it
Girl you look so fire
I'm like
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Them hips don't lie
The way you twerkin' it
Girl you look so fire
I'm like
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Do your dance
Do your, do your, do your dance
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
Get it, get it
Don't stop
