		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will follow you
Follow you wherever you may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep me away

I must follow you 
Ever since you touched my hand I know
That near you I always must be 
And nothing can keep you from me
You are my destiny

I love you I love you I love you and where you go 
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow

You'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love
From now until forever, forever, forever

I will follow you
Follow you wherever you may go
There isn't an ocean too deep 
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away away from my love

I love you, I love you, I love you and where you go 
I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow

You'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love
From now until forever, forever, forever

I will follow you
Follow you wherever you may go
There isn't an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away away from my love
A where you go I'll follow
