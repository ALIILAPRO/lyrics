		  (Could this thing be more?)
(You can never, this could be yours)
(If it's really meant to, baby, baby)
('Cause I'm interested, baby, baby)
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me (love with me)
Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did (I did)

Takin' our memories on love and treatin' it like nothin' (treatin' it like nothin')
Takin' our memories on love and treatin' it like gossip (treatin' it like gossip)
It's my love from my grandmother make me gentle when I care for you (when I care for you)
Tell me you fallin' out of love, just breakin' my heart in two (heart in two)
I just don't wanna sit and pray, baby
Almost like it didn't happen to make you happy

You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me (love with me)
Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did (I did)
You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me (you tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me)
Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did
(Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did, I did)

(Could this thing be more?)
(You tellin' me you fallin' out of love with me)
It's my love from my grandmother make me gentle when I care for you 
(You can never, this could be yours)
(Hope you can find someone to love you better than I did)
(If it's really meant to, baby, baby)
('Cause I'm interested, baby, baby)
