		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you know that this shit is about to fly
Wanna see us fall i see the hating in their eyes
We out here
(Ah ah ah)
They know we out here
(Ah ah ah)

UH

Why they hating for?
Why they hating for?
Why they hating on?
Why they hating on me for?
On me for?
What they looking at?
Why they looking at?
Who they looking at?
Why they looking at me for?
At me for?

When you do you it's a problem
They aint fucking with you but they still talking about you
I'll be just fine smoking good living prosper
Chilling with my family while my granny cooking lobster
When you do you it's a problem
They aint fucking with you but they still talking about you
I'll be just fine smoking good living prosper
Chilling with my family while my granny cooking lobster

I know this aint something i can do all on my own
If you aint about it get the fuck up out my zome
We out here
(Ah ah ah)
They know we out here
(Ah ah ah)

UH

Why they hating for?
Why they hating for?
Why they hating on?
Why they hating on me for?
On me for?
What they looking at?
Why they looking at?
Who they looking at?
Why they looking at me for?
At me for?

When you do you it's a problem
They aint fucking with you but they still talking about you
I'll be just fine smoking good living prosper
Chilling with my family while my granny cooking lobster
When you do you it's a problem
They aint fucking with you but they still talking about you
I'll be just fine smoking good living prosper
Chilling with my family while my granny cooking lobster
