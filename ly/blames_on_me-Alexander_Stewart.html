		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The worst part is you're innocent
In all of this 
I was just calling quits
You were giving me all that I could need 
I was missing it
Now I'm all alone going through our old messages
And I'm getting it

Usually I'm the one getting burned
Didn't realize I was hurting you 

Oh, God, I'm sorry 
I put you through hell
You tried to love me when I hated myself 
I know it's too late for apologies
For all of the mistakes that I didn't see
The blame's on me
(The blame's on me, the blame's on me, the blame is on)

Hate this is such a cliché (cliché)
Don't know what, what you have 'til it's gone away (gone away)
But that don't take, take away any pain (any pain)
I'm still here sleeping in the bed I made
Next to an empty space 

Usually I'm the one getting burned
Didn't realize I was hurting you 

Oh, God, I'm sorry 
I put you through hell
You tried to love me when I hated myself 
I know it's too late for apologies
For all of the mistakes that I didn't see
The blame's on me
(The blame is on me, the blame is on me, the blame is on me)
The blame's on me
(The blame is on me, the blame is on me, the blame is on me)

Oh, God, I'm sorry 
Hope that you're well
Someone who loves you, like I couldn't myself
