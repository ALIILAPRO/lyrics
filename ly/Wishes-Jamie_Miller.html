		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm throwing out the page I found
The memory about you and I
There's a time I dreamed about
The place we'll go on a summer night
So take me to your deepest heart
Now I really need proof to go on
'Cause my life goes dark
When I know that I can never be your love (woah)

Wish we never talked
Wish we never saw
But now I know you're just too far
To catch you with my arms

Wish I never met you
Wish I never touched your hand
On the day I really thought you were 
The only one that I could ever really love

I'm not a person that believed
About the things that people talk
But the things you said, they made my world
I never doubted you were wrong (oh)
So take me to your deepest heart
Now I really need proof to go on
'Cause my life grows dark
When I know that I can never be your love
Oh

Wish we never talked
I wish we never saw
But now I know you're just too far
To catch you with my arms

I wish I never met you
I wish I never touched your hand
On the day I really thought you were 
The only one that I could ever really love

Just tell me that I'm wrong
Or say anything at all
I don't care if it's true or false
No, don't tell me your excuses
Was the love we had honest?
Was it ever true?

I wish we never talked
I wish we never saw
But now I know you're just too far
To catch you with my arms

I wish I never met you
I wish I never touched your hand
The day I really thought you were
The only one that I could ever really love
