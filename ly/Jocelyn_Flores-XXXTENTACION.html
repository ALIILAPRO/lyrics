		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I've been trapped in my mind girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend there's something, we're nothing
I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold back

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been tripping 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
Wanna fucking end it
Pessimistic
All wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm digging
Having conversations about my haste decisions
Fucking sickening
At the same time, memory surfaced through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playing with a slipknot
Post traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since a couple months they had a nigga locked up

I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb
I be feeling pain, I be feeling pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

I know you so well, I know you well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty
