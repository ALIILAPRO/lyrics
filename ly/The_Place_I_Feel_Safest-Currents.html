		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The secrets that we keep, they don't do justice to our good deeds
This feeling I can't shake, that I can't be heard
Why does this darkness feel so familiar?
As I begin to breathe, I awake to a new direction; this overwhelming sadness that won't leave
Stay strong, stand tall, I'm here for you
All words that fall short of healing the wounds
This distant doom (Can you hear me? Can you feel me?)
There's nothing here for me
No greatness to achieve
You can't get over it
Just suppress, then count the days until the feeling comes back again
I've got this feeling, this shortness of breathing
I've got the courage but don't have the meaning
I lose in love, I lose in life
These walls built to protect
Me cause my disconnect
I set the course; opening the same doors I have before
I've pushed you so far away, I can't make up this space
Looking in the same goddamn mirror every night, I stare and wonder why I can't fight
You're to be held, not to be missed
You've shown the greatest love I've ever witnessed
I hope you get the life you see in your dreams, even if it's not including me
The secrets that we keep, they don't do justice to our good deeds
This feeling I can't shake, that I can't be heard
Why does this darkness feel so familiar?
I want it back. I miss the bond of our skin, I miss the touch of your hand
I want it back, I want it back. And I want it bad
I can't shake, I can't shake, I can't shake this
Far away from the place I feel safest
I'm reaching out as I watch you leave
You're abandoning me, you're abandoning me
You can't undo every word you've muttered out of turn
You've been conditioned to hate, some things can't be unlearned
Wrong; you're condemned and fit to be misled
This can't be dead. This can't be dead
