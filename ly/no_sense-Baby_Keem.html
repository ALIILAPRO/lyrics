		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you mad at me? Are you irritated? 
I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Why you showing off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showing out when you with your friends, dawg

Don't be showing out when you with your man's, dawg
Please don't let me catch him on my ends, dawg
It's a thousand ways to misunderstand, dawg
It's a thousand ways that we can make amends, dawg
And you know he only love you when your pants off
I showed you, light I showed you grown man talk
Age differences between us, on our last, dawg
I'm coming home, why you always on the edge, dawg?

Are you mad at me? Are you irritated? 
I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Why you showing off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showing out when you with your friends, dawg

Makes no sense dawg, dawg, dawg
These niggas tryna ride the wave
Ride the wave
Makes no sense dawg, dawg, dawg
These bitches tryna ride my face
Ride my face (yeah, let's go)

Sorry momma you ain't need to know this
Sorry momma but I couldn't focus
You ain't gonna have my back against the ropes
You popping pussy like that bitch go then
I'm walking down the aisle doing my Dougie
If I'm walking down the aisle I hope you love me
I like it skinny and I like it chubby
As long as we involved it won't bug me
Hoe, it's your birthday, your birthday
It's your birthday we gotta take a picture
It's your birthday from now to December
It's a birthday, how could I not remember?
We fucked so I cleaned up your roster
Got rid of the Hypebeast impostors
Taught hoes how to talk to you proper
'Cause I get good results like a doctor

Are you mad at me? Are you irritated? 
I let you duck me, then you celebrated
Why you showing off because you with your friends, dawg?
Don't be showing out when you with your friends, dawg

Makes no sense dawg, dawg, dawg
These niggas tryna ride the wave
Ride the wave, yeah
Makes no sense dawg, dawg, dawg
These bitches tryna ride my face
Ride my face
