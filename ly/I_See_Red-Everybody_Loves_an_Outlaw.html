		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you really think
I'd just forgive and forget, no
After catching you with her
Your blood should run cold, so cold
You, you two timing, cheap lying, wannabe
You're a fool
If you thought that I'd just let this go

I see red, red, oh red
A gun to your head, head, to your head
Now all I see is red, red, red

Did you really just say
She didn't mean anything, oh
I'll remember those words
When I come for your soul, your soul
Know that you, you dug your own grave
Now lie in it
You're so cruel
But revenge is a dish best served cold

I see red, red, oh red
A gun to your head, head, to your head, oh
Executioner style, and there won't be no trial
Don't you know that you're better off dead
All I see is red, red, oh red
Now all I see is

Run, hide
Oh, you're so done
Better sleep with one eye open tonight

I see red, red, oh red, oh
A gun to your head, head, to your head, oh
Executioner style, and there won't be no trial
Don't you know that you're better off dead
All I see is red, red, oh red
Now all I see is red, red
