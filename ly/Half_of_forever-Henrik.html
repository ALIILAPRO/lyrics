		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey I know
Wherever you Go
I'd give up half of forever
I'd give up half of forever
They don't know
They never will
What we have
And how we feel
They can't take this love away
Clouds will come
Come with rain
And we'll grow old
Old and grey
But we're not bound by time and space
Honey I know
Wherever you Go
I'd give up half of forever
I'd give up half of forever
Offer me up I'm yours
All of my love I'm sure
I'd give up half of forever
I'd give up half of forever
Just to be with you
Ooooo
Just to be with you
Ooooo
Just to be with you
Ooooo
I'd give up half of forever just to be with you
So baby be mine when the sun sets
Til the day that it doesn't come up yea
Run away til our lungs give up
I'll breathe your air til I turn to the dust
Honey I know
Wherever you Go
I'd give up half of forever
I'd give up half of forever
Offer me up I'm yours
All of my love I'm sure
I'd give up half of forever
I'd give up half of forever
Just to be with you
Ooooo
Just to be with you
Ooooo
Just to be with you
Ooooo
I'd give up half of forever just to be with you
Honey I know
Wherever you Go
I'd give up half of forever
I'd give up half of forever
Just to be with you
