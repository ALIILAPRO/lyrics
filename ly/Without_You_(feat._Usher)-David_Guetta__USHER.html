		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game without you
Without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same without you
Without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by without you
Without you
Uh, I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I, without you
Without you

Oh oh oh
You, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged without you
Without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night without you
Without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed without you
Without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind without you
Without you

Oh oh oh
You, you, you
Without you, you, you
Without you

I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same without you
Without you
Without you
