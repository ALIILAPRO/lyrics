		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, do you see these lashes?
I mean, she says she's writing another book
But like
I thought she was in med school, but
Her real name not even London
Yo, wifey just costs so much
She's not even verified
Ain't nobody wanna hear them big ass words
Can't understand that shit
That girl voice is so annoying
I can't take it (Uno)

I was extorted, but I can't speak to it
I'm legally binded to turn a cheek to it
Word to my bible, I'd LA leak this shit
Put it on vinyl and put a beat to it
But just to know that they
Plottin' before the Grammy
I'm better off if I watch
Who I call my family
Stop it, you all scare me
Plottin' to all scam mе
Get in the call shift
And they strip you to bra and pantiеs
I lost everything on my hard drive
Seventeen-thousand, five hundred
Thirty-one hours of sitting vertical
Powering all my bars right
And now I'm just battling all my dark nights
I've met with every single
Label in a nutshell at the table
They put shackles on my bust down
Lady, why you want your masters
If you up now?
I'm from the bottom of the block
Even Uptown i gave my all to a nigga
Who ain't give a fuck
Feelin' small to a nigga who was big enough
I thank the Lord for a
Picture of a bigger cup
'Cause the shit will runneth empty
If I picked it up bottomless pit
Dug out, bottomless ditch
And for my pain, I got bottomless dick
Well, it felt better sayin' it in private
But I'm a lot more David than Goliath
Quiet is cap
I'm a giant when I'm high on myself
And I get tiny when I'm fighting for help
But I don't drug abuse, I never wanted to
'Cause every time I get
To feelin' something, i'll thug it through
Fuck it too it's seamless what I want
A genius, a savant
And I've been secret all season 'cause
I'm lenient to a fault
And I let everybody lap me now
Gave everybody they flowers and pat-me downs
Now I'ma wrap him 'round
Uh, ring around the rosie for competitors
I put the bling around the
Rollie and embezzled her
I was down on my worst, you'll never now
Six hundred for my perfume regular
In and out of town and balling out
Weight up and down, hair falling out
Giving everybody help
Really taking care of everybody, but myself
Not myself (Uh)
Clark Kent call for me every week
Which is fitting
He knew me since I was three
He tell me I'm amazing
Tell me I'm the greatest
When I doubt that I'ma make it, he say
"Who you see?"
"Because I see someone incredible, I
See you on a pedestal
And don't you let the Devil
Even through to speak"
Said, "Not only will you make it
But hear me when
I say this, when it come to God's favorite
Then it's you and me"
Realizing that they love you
'til you tell 'em, "No"
They don't get no real muscle
'til you let 'em go
Shit, I still struggle
But you'll never know
I won't say I still trust
You 'cause I never will

I won't say I still trust
You 'cause I never will
Shit, I still struggle
But you'll never know
Her name's Lady London
Oh, yeah, we know Lady London
Oh, there's one girl named, um, Lady London
Lady London she's fuckin' beauty
If you don't know who Lady London is
The Aristotle of bravado
If you don't know who Lady London
This Lady London, Sway in the
Morning, Shade 45, DJ Wonder
Drop a beat on her
That's the girl Lady London
That girl you talked
About last week, she's super dope too
Lady London (yeah)
Yeah, shoutout to Lady London
She's fuckin' dope
She's Oh, man, she's a sweetheart
She's the Aristotle of bravado
