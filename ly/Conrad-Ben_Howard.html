		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Climb out
Out to where you see
The curl of the world,

We're alone
Just like you said
Cold cold world,

Life lasts
Only one thing left to roll
Last year to learn,

You were the boat that bridged
In the tale of Conrad
We will never be the change
To the weather and the sea and you knew that,

You were the boat that bridged
In the tale of Conrad
Oh I loved you with the good
And the careless of me
But it all goes back,

Oh climb out
Out enough to see
The curl of the world,

Oh we're alone
Just like you said
Last year to learn,

You were the boat that bridged
In the tale of Conrad
We will never be the change
To the weather and the sea and you knew that,

You were the boat that bridged
In the tale of Conrad
Oh I loved you with the good
And the careless of me
But it all goes back,

You were the boat that bridged
In the tale of Conrad
We will never be the change
To the weather and the sea and you knew that,

You were the boat that bridged
In the tale of Conrad
Oh I loved you with the good
And the careless of me
But it all goes back,
