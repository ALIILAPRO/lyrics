		  Where we at now?
Uncle Manson
Cameron Giles
And I'm Mason Betha
And this Untertainment
And we're gonna rise to the top
Jacob the Chancellor
And Troy Topper (check this)

Ayo you might see Cam in designer underwear
New reclining leather chair, reminders everywhere
How we pull up in whips the minors stop and stare
And when it comes to girls they behind us everywhere
I mean when I hang up on 'em they pressin' redial
I mean, what the fuck is it why you stressin' me child?
It'd be one thing if you were finessin' my style
But when I go to court, you know the dress of the trial
You not my wife, so if I ask head I be fowl
You better be down, the only question better be, how
Threaten me now, bet me a thou', no girl deadin' me now
In the SC we're gone, are you sexy in thongs?
If you'll sex in the Lex' and your head be the bomb
I'll get you that shit that Gretzky skate on
What you mean 'Gretzky be on'? Ice, hockey

Please mamacita (oh you're gonna buy me diamonds) 
Horse and carriage is for hire (bitch, shut the fuck up)
Mamacita, please senorita
We're gonna rise to the top
Horse and carriage
See my love's for hire

Yo, ayo I love when cats think 
They bigger than a sumo
That when I hit 'em with some Puerto Rican judo
Uh, you don't know what that is
That's when I say, "They don't know who gat this is"
(And you don't know?) Yo' guns is hand me downs
(And you don't know?) We'll put you where you can't be found
(And you don't know?) You better toughin' up
('Cause you don't know) nigga will fuck you up
(And you don't know?) Baby, we don't need you
And when it comes to Jimmy, my name's, "Me Too"
'Cause when he got cash, I was like, "Me too"
And when he got ass I said, "Me too"
And when he got the drop I was like, "Me too"
And when he almost got shot I said, "Me too"
What you get now is just a preview

Please mamacita (we all tinted out)
Horse and carriage (your car's see-through I see you)
Is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We're gonna rise to the top
Horse and carriage, see my love's for hire (yo, yo)

Ayo, I pull to the hotel with my shit on blast
Tell the valet, "Motherfucker, don't hit my Jag"
Seen the bell boy, nigga he can kiss my ass
Just show me my room nigga, and get my bags
So the girl, that's my hon, almost dropped his glass
I guess he was shocked when I touched her ass
But it really wasn't nothin' she was peedy a'ight
"Does that say Harlem World?" Yeah, you readin' it right
And we havin' a party, be there tonight
Like Phil Collins, have her in the heat of the night
'Cause Cam' rocks the party (all night long)
'Til when? ('Til the early morn')
It don't stop and uh 
It don't quit and uh 
I drive six and uh 
We pop Cris, and uh
Right now too tipsy to drive

Please mamacita (but ma, I got my horse and carriage right outside)
Horse and carriage is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We're gonna rise to the top
Horse and carriage
See my love's for hire

Horse and carriage is for hire
Mamacita, please senorita
We're gonna rise to the top

Michael Foster, Huddy Combs
Jimmy Jones, Stason Betha and Bloodshed for ever
And we're gonna rise, and we're gonna rise
And we're gonna rise to the top 
Andre Thompson (woo)
