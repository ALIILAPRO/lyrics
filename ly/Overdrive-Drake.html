		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold the line, we ain't done
Don't give up this divine bond between us
The tide is high, nothing's lost
Could turn over a new leaf, for my love, oh
A broken frame, and I know
It's pictures of jealousy
You don't believe me when I show you often
With sacrifices and time
My heart is in overdrive
With you beside me, I become unraveled
And you can see right through me
No, we can't go down like this
You are afraid to be fully open
Though you can see all my cards
My heart is in overdrive

My heart is racing 
I cannot slow down and it's bothering me
How forward of me would it be to tell you to forward to me?
You should be right here anyways 
Your energy's calling for me
There's deeper places we can go 
Don't have to just party with me
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it, oh, oh
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it
I hope we can make it, oh

Hold the line, we ain't done
Don't give up this divine bond between us
I'm hanging on, but you don't see
It's a phase we'll overcome, my love, oh
The tide is high, and I know
It's just waves of jealousy
Me and you, jealousy
You don't believe me
When I show you often
With sacrifices and time
My heart is in overdrive
With you beside me, I become unraveled
And you can see right through me
No, we can't go down like this
You are afraid to be fully open
Though you can see all my cards
My heart is in overdrive

(I miss you, I've been thinking about you)
(And I've been thinking about our love)
(I miss you)
