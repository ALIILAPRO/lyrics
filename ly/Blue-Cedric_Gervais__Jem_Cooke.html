		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel a rush of blood coming to my head
So many colors driving out all the red
I lift my hands to heaven
I never felt a wave like this
Another rush of blood is coming
Into my head

Ooh
Let's run into the blue
Ooh
Come with me to the blue

Run in, that's all I wanna do
It's waiting for me and you
Let's run into the blue

Somebody close is calling me by my name
But I have gone somewhere else
I'm somewhere so far away
Falling through a prism
I watch the white light spin
Don't pull me out of this sweet moment
Just come on in

Ooh
Let's run into the blue
Ooh
Come with me to the blue

Run in, that's all I wanna do
It's waiting for me and you
Let's run into the blue

Ooh
Let's run into the blue
Ooh
Come with me to the blue

Run in, that's all I wanna do
It's waiting for me and you
Let's run into the blue
