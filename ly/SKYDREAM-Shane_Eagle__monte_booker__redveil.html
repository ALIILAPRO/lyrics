		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Real shit

Skydream, look to the heavens tryna find myself
Skydream, look to the heavens tryna find myself
I opened doors and got the keys to this shit
I got rich and didn’t know I was rich (Nigga)
Moving like I've got the portal gun on my hip
Moon jumping, moon mapping
Still the realest nigga since everything happened (It happened)
Nobody cook it like me, no
Nobody cooking like me, no
Nobody cooking like (Yeah, yeah)

P-A-I-N, I gotta let it bleed
K-I-N-G, this for the kings
My music timeless, dodge labels and dodge sirens
Then find myself staring back at the skyline, yeah

Yeah hey skydream, you’re so precious to me
Yeah hey skydream, you’re so precious to me (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah
These sky dreams is my same reflections
Boy you're not my brother
We don't even got the same inflection, uh
Hand me this onus of protection of my energy
My memory present
Don't really mean that I'm gon' change direction, look
Put my foot on this titanium lever got 'em shook
You ain't never gotta look
Tryna sell me pages, never read the book
These niggas rap like they ain't never felt a hook, yeah

These niggas rap like they ain't never felt, look
Pushing this shit my mantra
Value the truth way over the double entendre
Hanging my fist out the Honda
On my Black Panther, nigga, ain't talking Wakanda
These niggas smell like the contras
Don't got my honour at all
Good looks for trying to point out the snakes but nigga I'm sharp like Katana
You want that dream, gotta handle the sauna
Skin tone got me ducking the Jakes
We don't believe that you boys is piranhas
2021, when these niggas is fakes
2022, I'm on my Rihanna
Anti, you can't eat off my plate
For goodness' sakes my nigga

Yeah hey skydream, you’re so precious to me
Yeah hey skydream, you’re so precious to me
Blindside
