		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, you send me
Darling, you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do oh oh oh

You thrill me
Darling you thrill me
Baby, you, you thrill me
Honest you do, honest you do, honest you do

At first, thought it was infatuation
Ooh, it lasted so long, so long
Now I find myself wanting
I want you to marry me, please take me home
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You, you send me
Darling, you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest you do, honest you did, you know you did
You know you do now

You send me (you got everything it takes to win me)
You send me (and when you do the things you do)
You send me (you know you send me)
Honest you

You send me
You send me
Baby, you send me
You're moovy, you're groovy
Woo! you send me

I just, I just, I just dare you to send me
Guess I'ma a sinner
Make me a longer
I, I, I, I, I, I just can't stand it
Thrill me, kill me
Woo, send me, send me baby
Pretty baby, yeah
