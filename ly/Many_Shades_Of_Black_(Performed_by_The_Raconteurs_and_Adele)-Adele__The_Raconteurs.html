		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door
See if I cry
See if I shed a single sorry tear
Can't say that it's been that great
No in fact it's been a wasted worried year

[Chorus]
Everybody sees
And everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong
And it's been that way to long
Take it as it comes
And be thankful when it's done
There's so many ways to act
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Let it out, let it all out
Say what's on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind
Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all

[Chorus]

Yeah there's many shades of black

[Chorus]

Cause there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's any shades of black
There's so many shades of black
Yeah there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black
And there's many shades of black
There's so many shades of black

Go ahead...
