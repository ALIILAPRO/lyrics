		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Want me to pull up?

I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hunnid for your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

Girl, I got you another dress
So bring yo' ass up-down them stairs
I buy you shit because you rare
And plus because you know I care
Bitch, you know you love it here
That's why you keep on comin' near
Your nigga can't compete, I swear (nah, for real)
He tried, but now he look too weak, baby

I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hunnid for your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair

I'll come and slide by 8 p.m.
And send a text to your DM
Five hunnid for your fuckin' hair
Two hunnid for your fuckin' nails
You runnin' out of shoes to wear
So I bought you another pair
