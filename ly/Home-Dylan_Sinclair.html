		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we'll live this through
Beat us black and blue
I'll stay only if you do
We were built to last for life
In a state of mind
Live until we die

When you're all alone
Remember where home is
I'm your boulevard
We fully control this
When you're all alone
Remember where home is
I'm your boulevard
We fully control this

My sight's not limited to
Present me and you
I live in the future
My bride, my heart doesn't use
Distance as excuse
To find something new

When you're all alone
Remember where home is
I'm your boulevard
We fully control this
When you're all alone
Remember where home is
I'm your boulevard
We fully control this

I could be bothered, baby
I know the drill
We could be taught it maybe
Learn on our own
Sleeping's a bother baby
Missing your warmth
Walking around and walking around and
I could be bothered, baby
I know the drill
We could be taught it maybe
Learn on our own
Sleeping's a bother baby
Missing your warmth
Walking around and having nothing to hold
