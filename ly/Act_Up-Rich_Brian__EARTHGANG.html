		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, walk into the room
Boy, they actin' like they seen a ghost (act up)
We gon' tear it down
Clear the witnesses before we go (act up)
Yeah, ridin' 'round, actin' crazy, better not get too close (act up)
Better shut it down, 'cause you know we poppin' off the most (act up)

Boom ba di di da da da dadum
Boom ba di di da da da dadum
Boom ba di di da da da dadum
Boom ba di di da da da dadum

We the last ones left, it ain't far fetched (ay)
Case you people haven't recognized yet (ay)
We been lookin' flyer than the fighter jet (ay)
Want the smoke, I got a pack of cigarettes (ay)
I'm the sailor and I ain't a pirate (ay)
Get the mic, I spit the dialect (ay)
Love is public but the jet is private (ay)
I take off, mask off then (ay)
Let 'em know face to face that they got a price to pay
I roll with the bros then get rid waste of spaces
Get 'em all purple like lakers
Vacate safely back to the safehouse
Knock, knock, knock like who be fakes now
Air force with me not no shoes
We givin' out bruises
Life would be better with no Judas

Yeah, walk into the room
Boy, they actin' like they seen a ghost (act up)
We gon' tear it down
Clear the witnesses before we go (act up)
Yeah, ridin' 'round, actin' crazy, better not get too close (act up)
Better shut it down (act up), 'cause you know we poppin' off the most (act up)

Boom ba di di da da da dadum
Boom ba di di da da da dadum
Boom ba di di da da da dadum
Boom ba di di da da da dadum

Face the past head on, I ain't scared, I was born for this, I'm prepared
I'm the one they waitin' on, I'm the answer to the peoples prayers
Baby, I came from the streets, I got my game from the streets
I'm a warrior until my last breathe, defend the family legacy
Yea, when you know who you are, nah, baby, nah, they can't never defeat ya
Ooh, ah, I punch a hole through 'em all, I punch a hole through the evil
Ooh, ah, I got so quick with kicks I got no dirt on my sneakers
Styles like dim sum, choose one, I got the ether

Yeah, walk into the room
Boy, they actin' like they seen a ghost (act up)
We gon' tear it down
Clear the witnesses before we go (act up)
Yeah, ridin' 'round, actin' crazy, better not get too close (act up)
Better shut it down (act up), 'cause you know we poppin' off the most (act up)

Kickin' it, kickin' it, kickin' it, kickin' it, who wants next? (let's go)
The quickest of hands, and I got your mans, you lookin' perplexed (ow)
Told 'em listen, I know who I am, I ain't gotta flex (uh-huh)
I'm hard to impress (yeah, yeah)
I'm good and I'm blessed (yeah, yeah)
I move with finesse (yeah, yeah), I'm slidin' like ice, I burn my steps (yeah, yeah)
I'm cool in real life (yeah, yeah), you cool on the net (yeah, yeah)
We not the same, fakin' to me is you doin' your best (yeah, yeah)
Word to my momma, I value my honor, I get my respect (yeah)
