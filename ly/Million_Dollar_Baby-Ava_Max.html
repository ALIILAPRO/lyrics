		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (She's a miracle)
(She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Diamonds
She turns tears to diamonds, whoa-oh
Tryin' to find that silver lining, whoa-oh-oh

And once in a while, I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hiding in the shadows
Praying that she'll break free

In the dark of the night, she got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby, nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh
She broke out of her chains, turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby, she's bound to drive you crazy
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh

Heart broke, oh-oh
You can't keep her down though, oh-oh (ah, ah, ah)
Ice cold, oh-oh
She's coming back to life though, oh-oh-oh

And once in a while, I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Counting down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hiding in the shadows
Praying that she'll break free

In the dark of the night, she got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby, nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh
She broke out of her chains, turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby, she's bound to drive you crazy
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, miracle
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, miracle
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh

In the dark of the night, she got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby, nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh (she's a miracle)
She broke out of her chains, turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby, she's bound to drive you crazy
She's a miracle (she's a miracle, yeah)
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, miracle
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, miracle (oh)
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma-ma-ma (oh)
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, oh
