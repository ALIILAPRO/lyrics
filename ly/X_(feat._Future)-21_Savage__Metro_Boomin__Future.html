		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ten bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock, them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard, then your money start expandin'
I got model bitches wanna lick me like some candy
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Savage, bitch, but no, I'm not Randy
Hit her with no condom, had to make her eat a Plan B
And I'm sippin' on that codeine, not brandy (21)

Ha (ha), I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (ha)
Huh (hol' up), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (ha)
Hol' up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (21, 21, 21)
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace (21, 21)
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this (21, 21)
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet (ha, woah, woah)
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me (ha, woah)

Flexin' on that bitch, hol' up (flexin' on that bitch)
Bought a necklace on that bitch, hol' up (21, 21)
Her friend gon' lick me like a fruit roll up (roll, up, roll up)
She in her feelings on the 'Gram, grow up (Bandz)
21, flexin' on that bitch, hol' up (hol' up)
I ain't textin' back that bitch, hol' up (no way, no way)
I ain't stressin' 'bout that bitch, hol' up (Savage)
21 gon' get the stick, hol' up
Hol' up, hol' up, bitch, I like to ball (like to ball)
Hol' up, hol' up, without no weave, you bald
Hol' up, bitch, I spent your rent inside the mall (21, 21)
Hol' up, she got a nigga, but he broke, she lost (savage)
Hol' up, at this private location
Hol' up, put her back in rotation (woo)
Hol' up, bitches on me, immigration
Hol' up, goin' through the translations

Ha (ha), I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (ha)
Huh (hol' up), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (ha, 21)
Hol' up, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up, hol' up, nigga), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (21, 21, 21)
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace (21, 21, 21)
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this (21, 21)
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet (ha)
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me (woo, ha)

Hol' up (hol' up) bitch my Rolex on fleek (on fleek)
Hol' up, bitch my diamonds on fleek (bling-blaow)
Hol' up, I got gold on my teeth (hol' up, on my teeth, teeth)
Hol' up, you got rainbow on your feet? (Broke bitch)
Hol' up, corny niggas don't impress me
Hol' up, never let a bitch dress me
Hol' up, can't no motherfuckin' judge check me
Hol' up, I don't give a fuck about no ring (yuh)
Hol' up, money make my old bitches hate me
Hol' up (hol' up), bitch, you still stay on Section 8 (broke bitch)
Hol' up, my new bitch wetter than a lake (wet as fuck)
Hol' up, and she love to let me paint her face (21)
Hol' up, fell in love with some good throat
Hol' up, fell in love with some good throat
Hol' up, ripped them confidential papers up
Hol' up, you done made me wake my savage up (21, 21, hol' up)

Ha (ha), I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (ha)
Hol' up (ha), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (ha)
21, I'm just stuntin' on my ex-bitch (hol' up)
Hol' up (hol' up, hol' up, nigga), I'm just flexin' on my ex-bitch (21, 21, 21)
Fuck a wedding ring, I bought a necklace (21, 21)
Diamonds got the flu, try not to catch this (21, 21)
I left that ho alone 'cause she was ratchet (ha)
All these bitches salty, they can't stand me (ha)

Ten bad bitches in a mansion
Wrist on Milly Rock, them diamonds on me dancin'
When you workin' hard then your money start expandin'
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
And them drugs come in handy
Last name Hendrix, bitch, but no, I'm no Jimi
Hit her with no condoms, shipped her right back out the country
And I'm sippin' codeine, tats all on my stomach
