		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So cute, you think you could be the one to
Fuck me up, leave me cryin' in the bathroom
Good luck tryna put me in a bad mood
I got bigger problems than you
Go ahead, baby, hit me with your best shot
Send me up, let me down, that's so hot
Heartbreak, only way you're gettin' me off
Is nothing but a sad truth

Life's not fair, baby, this I know
Think too much, it'll kill ya slow
Live, laugh, love, yeah, it's all for show
One more hit, and I let it go

I don't need your hands between my thighs
Light a cigarette and tell me sweet, sweet lies
And I know that it's not very lady-like
But I'm already getting fucked by life
Tell me that it's love then change your mind
Only call me drunk and when it's late, late night
You can hit it from the back and make me cry
'Cause I'm already getting fucked by life

I'm already gettin', gettin' fucked by life
I'm already gettin', gettin' fucked by life
You can be my, na, na, na, side piece
I'm already getting fucked by life

Take my hands up off the wheel
And I'ma let it take control
Swerving around, nah, you can't fuck with me
I'm out here doing donuts
All this hot blood
Runnin', runnin' through my bloodstream
And it's likely that I'm on the ceiling
Anything that you can do to me, life can do to me better (uh)
Hair pulled back, eyes roll back, nothing's gettin' me wetter
Wanna disrespect, be my guest, it's cute you even try
But I'm already getting, getting fucked by life

It's only how I cope
Deep down I've always known
I care way more than most
And I've reached the end of my rope

I don't need your hands between my thighs
Light a cigarette and tell me sweet, sweet lies
And I know that it's not very lady-like
But I'm already getting fucked by life
Tell me that is love then change your mind
Only call me drunk and when it's late, late night
You can hit it from the back and make me cry
'Cause I'm already getting fucked by life

I'm already gettin', gettin' fucked by life
I'm already gettin', gettin' fucked by life
You can be my, na, na, na, side piece
I'm already getting fucked by life
