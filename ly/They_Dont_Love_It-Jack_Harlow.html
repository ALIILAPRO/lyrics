		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like

I've been smooth for so long, I'm tryna get rough
Fuck buffin' my nails, dawg, I'm tryna get buff
Fuck shaping my beard up, I'm liking the scruff
And fuck the hills 'cause I'm living my life in the cut
Can't imagine that I'm gon' meet my wife in the club
We gon' see though, I feel like she more of a CEO
Or maybe she doing volunteer work in Rio
It's not like I need her, but I would love to meet her
Another day, another dollar, another phone with another feature
I don't play goalie but I'm my brother's keeper
Surrounded by family, I'm not with other people
They say I got my pops demeanor and mother's features
The garden still private as ever, the gang thriving together
Ya boy striving to be the most dominant ever
The hardest white boy since the one who rapped about vomit and sweaters
And hold the comments 'cause I promise you I'm honestly better
Than whoever came to ya head right then
They ain't cut from the same thread like him
They don't study doin' work to get ahead like him
They don't toss and turn in the fuckin' bed like him

'Cause they don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it

I been laid back so long, I'm tryna get turnt
Fuck searching my name, dawg, that's how you get hurt
Fuck being likable, I'm tryna be unbreakable
I just realized that this whole game is takeable
If I want it and I do, yes, I want it
I don't care how you feel about it, I do what I wanna
I used to look up to the people that I'm moving in front of
It's not that crazy anymore, my city used to a come up
Bryson, Jack, Gee, James is up next
The rest is up to me, these lames is upset
My peers get upstaged, the fans are obsessed
My city is upcoming, it's people are oppressed
And I'm gon' change things
I'm up at Carmichael's tryna get on the same page
I heard about the rapper that you claimed was a mainstay
They had a nice run but they never gon' maintain because

They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
They don't love it, they don't love it
