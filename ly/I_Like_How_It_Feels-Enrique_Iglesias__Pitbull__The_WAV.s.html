		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's my time, It's my life, I can do what I like
For the price of a smile,
I got a ticket to ride,
So I keep living, 'cause it feels right
And it's so nice,
And I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels,

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know, never stop
Give me more, more, more
'Cause I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

Show me love, make us one,
Let's make a beautiful world
Take my hand, it's alright
'Cause tonight we can fly

So we keep living, 'cause it feels right
And it's so nice, and I'd do it all again
This time, it's forever
It gets better, and I, I, I like how it feels

I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels, I like how it feels
I like how it feels,

So just turn it up, let me go
I'm alive, yes you know, never stop
Give me more, more, more
'Cause I like how it feels
Oh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

What you consider the best, I consider mediocre,
I want my bank account like Carlos slim's, or at least mini Oprah
Baby just close your eyes and imagine any part in the world, I've been there
I'm like global warming, anything I just start to heat the things up, but I've been here
Time traveler, two time zones, give me some of my vodka any zone,
Enrique Iglesias, and translation, Enrique Churches, confession
Dale mamita, dimelo todo, alante tu hombre, yo me hago el bobo
No te preocupes, baby for real
Because you gonna like how it feels

'Cause I like how it feels
Ooh yeah, I like how it feels
You know I like how it feels
Oh yeah I like how it feels

I like how it feels
I like how it feels
