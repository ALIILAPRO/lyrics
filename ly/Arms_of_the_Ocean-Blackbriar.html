		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through the sound of raging waves
Her voice is leading me astray
I feel I need to be with her right away
For she sounds so sweet
I cannot leave her all alone
Here in this deep and dark blue unknown
  
Come swim to me in a forward motion
Lie with me in the arms of the ocean
Sing to me my lady of the sea
Show me the way with your melody

Oh my dear unwary sailor
Come to my shore, it's way safer
Than the roaring sea, I need you here with me
Oh my sweet unwary man
Follow my voice and take my hand
Let me take you to the promised land

Come swim to me in a forward motion
Lie with me in the arms of the ocean
Sing to me my lady of the sea
Show me the way with your melody

She's pulling me into the fathomless deep
There's nothing I can do
She's pulling me into eternal sleep
There we go

We're sinking with graceful motion
Lying forever in the arms of the ocean
Sing to me my lady of the sea
Sing me your lullaby so I can go peacefully
