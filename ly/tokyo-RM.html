		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up in Tokyo, feel like a torso
I know it's time to go
I see Pinocchio wearing a poncho
That's me some time ago

Do I miss myself?
Do I miss your face?
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't know (I don't know)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Life is a word that sometimes you cannot say
And ash is a thing that someday we all should be
When tomorrow comes
How different it's going to be?
Why do love and hate sound just the same to me?

I can't sleep
Homesick, babe
I just wanna
Stay right next to you
If I could choose my dream
I just wanna
Stay right next to you

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
