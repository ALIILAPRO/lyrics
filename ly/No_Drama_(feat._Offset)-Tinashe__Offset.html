		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't cop the coup, don't do shit for two (skrrt skrrt)
All black truck hangin' out the roof (frrt frrt)
Mobbin' through the hills pulled up with my crew (who?)
I can't cop the coup, don't do shit for two (nah)
Said I'm fallin' off but they won't JFK me (they what?)
Tried to be myself but they won't AKA me (ok)
AKA a pop star AKA a problem (pow)
AKA don't hold me back, I swear I got 'em (hey)
We pulled up in Gucci, dripped down in Gabbana (drip drip)
Bad as a wanna, only chasin' gunnas (ooh ooh)
I need me a side thing, hold the drama (hold the drama)
I need me a soldier, he gon' hold the line up (pow pow)

Don't want no drama ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la (skrrt skrrt)
And backed out in that oh my god (ooh ooh ooh)
Don't want no drama ma (no, hey)
Don't want no drama ma
We pulled up in that ooh la la (skrrt, skrrt skrrt)
And backed out in that oh my god (hey)
Don't want no drama ma (don't want no drama ma)

I can't cop the coup, don't do shit for two (skrrt skrrt)
All black truck hangin' out the roof (yeah)
Mobbin' through the hills pulled up with my crew (who?)
I can't cop the coup, don't do shit for two (nah)
I got way too many people all my niggas equal (hey)
If my life was like a movie I'd need fifty sequels (move it)
I need sixty bad bitches actin' like they single (hey)
Yellin', "you can't sit with us," throwin' up middle fingers

Don't want no dramama (I don't want no drama)
We pulled up in that ooh la la (ooh la la)
And backed out in that oh my god (oh my god)
Don't want no drama ma (I don't want no drama, no)
Don't want no drama ma (I don't want no drama, no)
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god
Don't want no drama ma (ooh ooh ooh)

Offset, Double R Phantom
She like the way I'm drippin' organic (drip drip)
Yacht on my wrist a Titanic (yah)
Could ride on this shit like a Benji (rah)
Get high on the perky and Xanny (ha)
From Dubai on the jet to Miami (Dubai)
When the chopper start kickin' it's damaged
Got Patek on her wrist and her panties (Patek)
Ain't no drama
In the back of my Maybach on coffee
Yeah, iced out summers (ooh)
Invite your main bitch to a slumber
My money long, out there yonder
Fat ass with a flat stomach (flat)
Baguette glass cost a whole hundred (baguette)
The coupe fast, doin' two hundred

Don't want no drama ma (I don't want no drama)
We pulled up in that ooh la la (ooh la la)
And backed out in that oh my god (oh my god)
Don't want no drama ma (I don't want no drama, no)
Don't want no drama ma (I don't want no drama, no)
We pulled up in that ooh la la
And backed out in that oh my god (oh my god, oh my god)
Don't want no drama ma

Don't want no
Don't want no drama ma
Yeah, no, no, no
Don't need no, don't want no, don't want no
