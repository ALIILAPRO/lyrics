		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
(Ha) work my body, so melodic
This beat goes right through my chest (Yup)
Everybody, ma and papi, came to party
Grab somebody work ya body, work ya body
Let me see you one, two step (Here we go)

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on (This beat is)

Outrageous, so contagious, make you crave it
(Jazze made it) so retarded, top-charted
Ever since the day I started
Strut my stuff, and yes, I flaunt it
Goodies make the boys jump on it
No, I can't control myself
Now let me do my one, two step (Come on)

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

Work your body everybody
Work your body

Automatic, supersonic, hypnotic, funky fresh
(Ha) work my body, so melodic
This beat goes right through my chest (Yup)
Everybody, ma and papi, came to party
Grab somebody work ya body, work ya body
Let me see you one, two step (Here we go)

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on

Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
We about to get it on

Everybody, came to party, work your body
Everybody, came to party, work your body

Rock it, don't stop it
Everybody get on the floor
Crank the party up we about to get it on
Let me see you one, two step
I love it when you one, two step
Everybody one, two step
We about to get it on
