		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint the sky red, burn this city down
We will make them suffer, hate and greed are terrible lovers

We victimize, dehumanize
I fantasize it's just you and I 
We victimize, dehumanize
I fantasize it's just you and I 

Violence and silence, sirens screaming out
Bodies shakin', dreams are forsaken here 
So run for your mothers
 
We victimize, dehumanize
I fantasize it's just you and I 
We victimize, dehumanize
I fantasize it's just you and I 

Living in a nightmare
It's like walking in a daymare
Yeah, the world no it don't care
When you scratch the soul until it's bare
You know it feels so good
When we fuck them all like we should
And count the bodies one by one
Our reign of terror has just begun
Our reign of terror has just begun
Our reign of terror has just begun

We victimize, dehumanize
I fantasize it's just you and I 
We victimize, dehumanize
I fantasize it's just you and I 

Our reign of terror has just begun
