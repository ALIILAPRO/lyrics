		  Damn
I'd risk it all for you
And when a nigga get jammed, I'ma call for you
Yeah, yeah
I'ma have to call your shit
(Dj on the beat so it's a banger)
Von

You know how it go (go)
When we in the streets (in the streets)
I'm with my partners, got my chopper like I'm NLE (NLE)
I'm out on bond, gang member with three felonies (three felonies)
Might go to jail, if I need you, would you be there for me? (Be there for me)
The police thirsty too (damn)
They just surround the block (surround the block)
Louis saw 'em comin' (damn)
He told BJ, and Top (ayy, watch out)
It was too late, I'm got (on God)
They snatch my chain, my watch (chain, my watch)
They threw me in the car (car)
Now couldn't you've held it done?

A nigga always in the street, I'm playin' foul (playin' foul)
I be up on trial (up on trial)
Locked up for a while (for a while)
I don't know if I'm gon' make it, I don't know if I'ma drown
I just know if I get locked up, I can count on you to ride

Would you ride? Would you ride?
Would you ride for a nigga?
Would you ride? Now would you ride?
Could you ride for a real?
You gon' ride, you gon' ride, pick a side
Don't you lie, come on ride 
Don't you lie to a nigga
Come on ride

I got court tomorrow (damn)
She say she gon' come (she gon' come)
I'm on trial, what I'm facin', nigga, murder one (murder one)
She held it down, lately, yeah, when I was on the run (on the run)
Held my gun (DJ on the-) huh? What? 
Who I love? Girl, you the only one (you the only one)
I'ma make you smile (make you smile)
Throw you some paper (throw you some paper)
Girl, just be patient when they done deliberatin' (yeah)
I'ma show you, you the greatest, all them other hoes be hatin' 
Now I'm rich and they can't take it, I'm just happy that we made it (Von)
Fuck it, I'd risk it all for you (I'd risk it all for you)
When a nigga get jammed, I'ma call for you (I'ma call for you)
All these hoes in love with who I am, I won't fall for it (no, I won't fall for it)
But a bitch like you, I'd give it all to her (I'd give all to her)

'Cause a nigga always in the street, I'm playin' foul (playin' foul)
I be up on trial (up on trial)
Locked up for a while (for a while)
I don't know if I'ma make it, I don't know if I'ma drown
I just know if I get locked up, I can count on you to ride

Would you ride? Would you ride?
Would you ride for a nigga?
Would you ride? Now would you ride?
Could you ride for a real?
You gon' ride, you gon' ride, pick a side
Don't you lie, come on ride (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)
Don't you lie to a nigga
Come on ride
