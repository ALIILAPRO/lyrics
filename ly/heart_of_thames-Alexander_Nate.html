		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait for me
Would you wait for me

See I don't know exactly
What I even mean to you
But I'm tryna find a way
To see you through

She's saying I'll come to you
Just don't fall for me
And I'll comfort you
Soon as you call for me

Oh I need your love
I need your love
Don't set me free now baby
It's in my blood

Running through a nigga vein now darling
You're in my lungs
I can't breathe, I can't sleep
No No No

I need your love
Dark times in the heart of things
Where the river runs

Far from the northside of Virginia
Good God how'd I get here
Either way you're the only one
That's gon' be my savior

See I don't know exactly
What I'll ever mean to you
But I'm tryna find a way
To see you through

She's saying I'll come to you
Just don't fall for me
And I'll comfort you
Do what you want with me

Oh I need your love
I need your love
Don't set me free now baby
It's in my blood

Running through a nigga vein now darling
You're in my lungs
I can't breathe, I can't sleep
Oh no I need your love

I need your love
Don't set me free now baby
You're in my blood

Oh running through a nigga vein now darling
You're in my lungs oh Lord
I can't breathe, I can't sleep
Oh no oh no

Got a flight in the morning
Round five in the morning
Gotta get me out of London
Been out with the mandem rollin'

Been out in Camden zonin'
But I know I gotta leave
I just hope that you're there
I'll be flying from the east
Will you wait for me

Baby please, baby please
Could you wait for me
I be on my way
I just hope and pray
That you're by your bed

And I'll be there for you
If you'll be there for me
And I'll comfort you
Do what you want with me

Oh I need your love
