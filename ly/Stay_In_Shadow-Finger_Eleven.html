		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So cold that you cannot cope 
With a frozen heart
I guess we blow apart
I guessed it from the start Stay in shadow
I'll run this world out
Stay in shadow
It's running out of time
Stay in shadow
I want to watch it drown
Stay in this now

Don't say because you can't
Say what we should have been 
Don't show what I resent
Don't know cause I forget

So cruel to be so blind 
Darkness was on my side
Now that you've come and gone
I know where I belong

Light is leaving as I watch you go
Light is leaving inside of my soul
