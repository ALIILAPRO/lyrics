		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me back to the city
Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
Take me back to the people
That call my people, yeah, I'm a long, long way
From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

This one goes out to the ones that feel like an underdog
Used to write me off, now they're changin' up the dialog
Raise a glass to the past and all 'em that we're provin' wrong
You can take me out the city, but I brought my fam along, yeah
And the memories are playin' in my head
But I won't let 'em burn me again
I came too far just to let go
Baby, I'm comin' back home, comin' back home

Take me back to the city
Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
Take me back to the people
That call my people, yeah, I'm a long, long way
From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

And my city knew my name before the name came
Livin' in the fast lane, ain't have to change lanes
Had a hoodie on my head, before the rain came
Sometimes family and friends, that's the same thing
I thought I knew all about pain, 'til the pain came
But I'm still in the hall of fame, 'cause I ain't hate the game
Never cared 'bout what it is or what it was
Never life your life in fear, live in love
For my city, shed tears and shed blood
In my city, I lost the ones that I love

Take me back to the city
Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
Take me back to the people
That call my people, yeah, I'm a long, long way
Take me back to the city
Yeah, call my city where everybody knows my name
Take me back to the people
That call my people, yeah, yeah, I'm on my way
From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, take me back, take me back, take me back)
From my city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(My city, my city)
My city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Take me back, take me back, hmm-mmm)
My city, my city (ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
My city, my city
