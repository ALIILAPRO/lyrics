		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jumpin' out the mud, twistin' blunts with my eyes closed
When I was comin' up, bitches died and now they bite flows
Wrist like a light show, glisten while the time pass
Pop you while you playin', do you the same way they did Dimebag
Jumpin' up in and I'm lettin' it go
Bumpin' you, buggin', got no where to go
Fuck a discussion, I'm killin' a flow
Turnin' up Bones, always stick to the prose
Fuckin' with me and I promise you die
Homicide victim, now your mama cry
Don't get caught slippin', hang you out to dry
One in the air before I go to slide
High when we ride, bulletproof caravan
Like a soccer mom, see it and say, "That can't be them"
No need for alarm, I'm just checkin' in
I know your whereabouts and how you livin', man
The graveyard warden, tombstone holdin'
Heard your shit once, it's like you're trying to be boring
First class boarding, 'round the world touring
El booked the shows and my family sends your orders

Jumpin' out the mud, twistin' blunts with my eyes closed
Jumpin' out the mud, twistin' blunts with my eyes closed
