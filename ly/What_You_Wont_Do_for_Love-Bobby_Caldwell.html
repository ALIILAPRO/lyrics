		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of

What you won't do, to do for love
You tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you
Make me do for love what I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

But then I only want the best, it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up
In my world, only you make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
Make me do for love what I would not do
