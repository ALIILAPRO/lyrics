		<p>
		  (Please don't save me)
(Please don't save me now)
(You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash) ayy, ayy

Look at me in my eyes
There ain't shit that sweet (that sweet)
I just spent a mil on my detox in a week
I been countin' pills, fuck is countin' sheep?
Tryna stack my money, this peace of mind ain't cheap
Yeah, it won't be long 'til I'm long gone
Yeah, scarring up my arms somewhere in a foreign (skrrt)
Everywhere I go, feelin' like I don't belong
Thinkin' about my OG's that I swore that was wrong
I just wanna ease my stress, I just wanna smile
Breakin' down in tears from my trauma as a child
Breakin' down in tears from the trauma happenin' now
1800-PAIN, that's the number you have dialed

All my friends is dyin', I'm ridin' in style
Tryna touch my heart, that's gon' take a while
Thank God for my brother, what the fuck would I do without Kyle?
Thank God for my brothers not leavin' me an only child
Whole gang 'round, but still I'm by myself
I need a high now, I'll trade it for my health
No matter where I go, this Glock up on my belt
Yeah, got me feelin' low, I fuck around and felt
I just checked my bag, baby, I ain't got much left
Just let me hit this line 'fore I turn to myself
Stole their peace of mind, I'm Doris Payne with the theft (let's get it)
Gaslight 'em all, make 'em blame it on their self (let's go)
Fentanyl in my veins like I'm waitin' on the end (the end)
Hope they learn from me and the places that I've been
I keep pressing Sage like, "We better have that kid"
'Cause I can't help but feel that it won't be long 'til I'm long gone
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long 'til I'm long gone
'Til I'm long gone, 'til I'm long gone

Ayy, look at me in my eyes
There ain't shit that sweet (that sweet)
I just spent a mil on my detox in a week
I been countin' pills, fuck is countin' sheep?
Tryna stack my money, this peace of mind ain't cheap
Yeah, it won't be long 'til I'm long gone
Yeah, scarring up my arms somewhere in a foreign (skrrt)
Everywhere I go, feelin' like I don't belong
Thinkin' about my OG's that I swore that was wrong
I just wanna ease my stress, I just wanna smile
Breakin' down in tears from my trauma as a child
Breakin' down in tears from the trauma happenin' now
1800-PAIN, that's the number you have dialed

(Please don't save me)
(Please don't save me now)
