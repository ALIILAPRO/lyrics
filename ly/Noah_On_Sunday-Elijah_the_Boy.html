		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First summer without you
So you know this shit is a goodie
I got LV on my hoodie
Told that bitch I'm back on my bully
All that money wasted on you
I'm a sphend it all on me
I'm a sphend it all on me
I'm a sphend it all on me
(what what what)
I just popped a 42 bottle
(Just to)
Pour it down a throat of a model
(Yessir)
I been at Noah every Sunday
And when I'm walking through I tell security to move
I just left my bitch now I feel like I got my groove back
Probably won't fall in love again but shit baby I knew that
When I walk inside the club they looking at me like who that
(Yeah)
Girl you know it's me
Poppin on your fyp
See me in the streets
This summer belong to me
Rocking Louie V, I got ksubi on the jeans
When it comes to dreams
I chase em by any means
(Ye-ahhh)
Working on myself baby I'm focusing on healing
Ain't looking for love but I'm still searching for a feeling
Could of did you wrong but the level up was more appealing
Now it's my
First summer without you
So you know this shit is a goodie
I got LV on my hoodie
Told that bitch I'm back on my bully
All that money wasted on you
I'm a sphend it all on me
I'm a sphend it all on me
I'm a sphend it all on me
(what what what)
I just popped a 42 bottle
(Just to)
Pour it down a throat of a model
(Yessir)
I been at Noah every Sunday
And when I'm walking through I tell security to move
(Tell security to move)
And when I'm waking through I tell security to move
(I been at Noah every Sunday)
And when I'm waking through I tell security to move
