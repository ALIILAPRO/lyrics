		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He told me sweet lies of sweet loves
Heavy with the burden of the truth
And he spoke of his dreams
Broken by the burden
Broken by the burden of his youth

"Fourteen years," he said
"I couldn't look into the sun
She saw him laying at the end of my gun"
Hungry for life
And thirsty for the distant river

I remember his hands
And the way the mountains looked
The light shot diamonds from his eyes
Hungry for life
And thirsty for the distant river

Like the scar of age
Written all over my face
The war is still raging inside of me
I still feel the chill
As I reveal my shame to you

I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo
I wear it like a tattoo
