		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Hold on
Whoa, whoa

Why you rushing me, baby?
It's only us alone
I don't want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed

And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right
Oh, I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, oh yeah

I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah (just let me sip this slow)
I'ma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah (just let me)

Whoa, ooh yeah

And I'ma lean 'til I fall, ooh yeah
And I don't give a damn
I felt the ground before
I left it all behind, baby
I didn't need no one
But I'm in need tonight, baby
I've been alone for too long
Oh, oh yeah

So, I won't say a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah, oh
I can't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right, ooh

I'ma touch you right, oh yeah (just let me sip this slow)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
Ooh, I'ma touch you right, girl (just let me)

Whoa, ooh yeah

Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well, girl, let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit yo' sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth, I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said, "Make enough so I can try some"
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that North North, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place
Shit, I did all of that on my own, aw yeah
