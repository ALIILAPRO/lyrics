		  (Ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah, ah-ah-ah)

Strange light revolves around you
You float across the room
Your touch is made of something
Heaven can't hold a candle too
You're made of somethin' new

Let's not get complicated
Let's just enjoy the view
It's hard to be a human
So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow outta control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

I'm havin' revelations
You dance across the floor
Beyond infatuation
How I obsessively adore you
That's what I do

I believe, I believe, I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get better than this

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow outta control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow outta control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

Heaven won't be the same

I believe, I believe, I could die in your kiss
No, it doesn't get, doesn't get better than, better than this

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow outta control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same

God only knows where this could go
And even if our love starts to grow outta control
And you and me go up in flames
Heaven won't be the same
