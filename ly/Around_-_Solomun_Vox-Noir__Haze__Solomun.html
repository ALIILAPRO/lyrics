		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt like you've been hurt before? 
By the ones that said they only loved you more? 

Inflicted pain and scars of sorrow
Like an empty shell I wait for tomorrow

I sit here wondering why you walked away
Did I ever do you wrong in any way? 

Was it something I said to you that made you change? 

There is no more sun, there is only cloudy days

Yeah 

What goes around will come around and come back and get yah

What goes around will come around and come back and get yah

Have you ever felt like you've been hurt before? 
By the ones that said they only loved you more? 

Inflicted pain and scars of sorrow
Like an empty shell I wait for tomorrow 

I sit here wondering why you walked away
Did I ever do you wrong in any way? 

Was it something I said to you that made you change? 

There is no more sun... there is only cloudy days

Yeah 

Have you ever felt like you've been hurt before? 
By the ones that said they only loved you more? 

Inflicted pain and scars of sorrow
Like an empty shell I wait for tomorrow

I sit here wondering why you walked away
Did I ever do you wrong in any way? 

Was it something I said to you that made you change? 

There is no more sun, there is only cloudy days

Yeah 

What goes around will come around and come back and get yah

What goes around will come around and come back and get yah
