		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh 
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
Oh yeah
And they're gone so fast, yeah
Oh, so hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
And when you get old and start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care?
Can you tell me who will still care?
Oh care

Mmmbop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop 
Ba du, yeah-e-yeah

Ba du bop, ba duba dop 
Ba du, yeah-e-yeah

Said oh yeah
In an mmmbop they're gone
Yeah yeah

Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows
It's a secret no one knows
Oh, no one knows

Mmmbop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop
Ba du bop, ba duba dop

Ba du, yeah-e-yeah

In an mmmbop they're gone
In an mmmbop they're not there
In an mmmbop they're gone
In an mmmbop they're not there
Until you lose your hair
Oh but you don't care, yeah

Mmm bop, ba duba dop ba do bop

No, you can't 'cause you don't know
Can you tell me? Oh yeah
You say you can but you don't know
Can you tell me? Oh (which flower's going to grow?)
No, you can't, but you don't know
Can you tell me? (if it's going to be a daisy or a rose?)
You say you can but you don't know
Say you can but you don't know
You don't know how, you don't know how
