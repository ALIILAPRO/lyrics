		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Greetings loved ones, let's take a journey
Yeah, the o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one
Uh-huh, baby you're a California girl

Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I will be young forever
You make me feel like I'm livin' a
Teenage dream, the way you turn me on
I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back, don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now baby I believe this is real
So take a chance and
Don't ever look back, don't ever look back
I'mma get your heart racing in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Yeah!

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy dukes, bikinis on top
Sun kissed skin, so hot, we'll melt you popsicle
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away, the one that got away
The o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one, the one (x3)
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a mini bar
D J's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
This a hickie or a bruise?
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacktop blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop, oh whoa oh
This Friday night, do it all again
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F.
T.G.I.F
T.G.I.F.

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you
You're from a whole nother world
A different dimension
You've opened my eyes
Now I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial

Do you ever feel
Like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again
Do you ever feel
Feel so paper thin
Like a house of cards
One blow from caving in
Do you ever feel
Already buried deep
Six feet under screams
But no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the 4th of July
Cause baby you're a firework
Come on show em what you're worth
Make em go oh oh oh
When you shoot across the sky-y-y
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon
Boom boom boom even brighter than the moon moon moon
