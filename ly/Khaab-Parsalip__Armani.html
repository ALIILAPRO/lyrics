		  Doubt
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Ain't Eva wait on me
These bitches doubted they doubted
I'll Neva wait on you
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Ain't Eva wait on me
These bitches doubted they doubted
I'll Neva wait on you
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
How could you doubt me
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Yea I'mma doubt you too
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
How could you doubt me
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Now I'mma doubt you too
If they wildin don't matter nigga the chain stay on
If it violent it's violent nigga the k stay warm
Need a baddie beside me just to tell me to stay calm
Tell dat Bitch if she ridin man the day will stay long
45 ain't a problem til the problem just step off
Any nigga that try me man they back will get gone
I'm just vibing really trying to stay out the damn storm
Tryin flip me but fuck it my light will stay on
I dip in the back so live
I trip in the back know why
I dip in the back so live
We lit in the back so high
I trip in the back know why
I dip in the back so live
I trip in the back know why
I dip in the back so live
We lit in the back so high
I trip in the back know why
I was sipping on da yak
Saw some Niggas who attacked
Had to flip em wit da Mack
Then i dip right thru da back
Steering whipping thru da dash
Now lil shawty wanna smash
Though addicted to the cash
Had to cut that Bitch in half
Niggas laughing not a joke
When dem niggas sink ya boat
I'm just Tryin stay afloat
2020 Niggas woke
Covid on deese Niggas coke
Covid on deese Niggas coke
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Ain't Eva wait on me
These bitches doubted they doubted
I'll Neva wait on you
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Ain't Eva wait on me
These bitches doubted they doubted
I'll Neva wait on you
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
How could you doubt me
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Yea I'mma doubt you too
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
How could you doubt me
Deese Niggas doubted they doubted
Now I'mma doubt you too
I dip in the back so live
I trip in the back know why
I dip in the back so live
We lit in the back so high
I trip in the back know why
I dip in the back so live
I trip in the back know why
I dip in the back so live
We lit in the back so high
I trip in the back know why
