		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when the bartender said it's on the house
You make me wanna fall in love
The weather felt better
When we were in it together

Oh I miss the way we used to talk about nothing
I hate to say I should've seen it coming

Last summer everything was easy
We had it all didn't we baby
No wonder you couldn't keep me
It got harder than you thought it would be

You stopped loving me on the dark nights
Now you won't kiss me in the sunlight
Last summer I knew you'd leave me
'Cause loving me isn't easy

'Cause loving me isn't easy

'Cause loving me isn't easy

If you wanted to talk you would've texted
If I wanted to stop I would've let it go
But I get it it's alright

'Cause I can't keep my shit together
Say fuck it yeah can't debate that
Don't want shit to get better
'Cause it'd make me forget it all and I hate that

Last summer everything was easy
We had it all didn't we baby
No wonder you couldn't keep me
It got harder than you thought it would be

You stopped loving me on the dark nights
Now you won't kiss me in the sunlight
Last summer I knew you'd leave me
'Cause loving me isn't easy

'Cause loving me isn't easy

'Cause loving me isn't easy
