		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's make a toast to the damned
Waitin' for tomorrow
When we're played out by the band
Drowning out our sorrows
What will become of us now at the end of time?
We'll be fine, you and I
Let's draw a line in the sand
Keep it straight and narrow
We had it all in our hands
We begged and then we borrowed
What will become of us all at the end of love
When we've stopped looking up?

You can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together, we can make a mark in the stars, we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

Let's tell the truth, just for once
Asking for an answer
Now that it's all said and done
Nothing really matters
What will become of us all if we dare to dream
At the end of the scene?

You can take my heart
Hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together, we can make a mark in the stars, we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark

Let's open up to the sky
Askin' it for closure
'Least we can say that we tried
But it's never really over
What will become of us all at the end of the line?
Will we live? Will we die?

You can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together, we can make a mark in the stars, we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
And you can take my heart
And hold it together as we fall apart
Maybe together, we can make a mark in the stars, we embark
And keep us together as the lights go dark
