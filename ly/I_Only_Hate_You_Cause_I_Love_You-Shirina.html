		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Does she love you
The way I used to do
When you fall asleep 
I hope you dream of me
While she's holding you

Well baby I still love you
But I'll never show
All the damage done 
I thought you were the one
How could you let me go

And baby she will never love you
The way I used to do
And I guess you can say I'm hating
But I'm just telling you the truth

I only hate you cause I love you baby 
I fucking hate that it's true
Cause after all this time I said that I've been fine
When I've been missing you
I only hate you cause I want you baby 
Wish I could stop myself
Cause baby in my heart
I hate that we're apart
And you're with someone else

I wanna call you
I wanna know the truth 
Do you regret the day
You turned and walked away
And broke my heart in two

But every time I try to call I never do
Cause I remember you're with someone new
And now I guess we'll never know

And baby she will never love you
The way I used to do
And I guess you can say I'm hating
But I'm just telling you the truth

I only hate you cause I love you baby 
I fucking hate that it's true
Cause after all this time I said that I've been fine
When I've been missing you
I only hate you cause I want you baby 
Wish I could stop myself
Cause baby in my heart
I hate that we're apart
And you're with someone else

Does she love you
The way I love you
When you fall asleep
Do you dream of her
While I dream of you

I only hate you cause I love you baby 
I fucking hate that it's true
Cause after all this time I said that I've been fine
When I've been missing you
I only hate you cause I want you baby 
Wish I could stop myself
Cause baby in my heart
I hate that we're apart
And you're with someone else
