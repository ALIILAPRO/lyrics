		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i watched it dying
right in front of my eyes
it's another sentiment to put back on the shelf

i trade my now
for that moment in time
where it all was new
yet the world could stay the same
stay the same


so how do you find
living in the mind
where each year has dressed you up
more beautifully

yet the more i try
the more you hide
been chasing your trail
but ended up running around
with nothing

hey is that the same old form
through which we've shaped our world around?

i could not face that part of letting go
but hoped to hear your sound

with your hand in mine
we could build a house
we could paint every room with our memories

i can't allow
can't leave the good thing behind
so i watch you as you tear this heart apart
