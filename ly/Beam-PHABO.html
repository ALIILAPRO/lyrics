		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Write yo' scent down, margarita
I just really wanna see ya
I just really, yeah

Feeling weak, like SWV
Negative energy, I don't need (Oh)
In the deepest, darkest water
My mind stayed sound (It stayed found)
You were nowhere to be found
('Where to be found)
So many tears I might drown
But they still coming down
Fading to black on me (Fading to black)
Why you turning your back on me?
(Turning your back)
The more I supply, the more you want
All the times you told me
That he wouldn't claim you
Even when you gave your all
Stop projecting all thе shit that
Such and such had did, You're not alone
'Cause it's fucking mе up

Just tell me the truth
(Truth, truth, truth, truth)
Need undivided attention, I'm talking to you
(You, you, you, you)
Now that I know where you stand
It's much harder to move
(Harder to move, move, move, move)
Maybe it's just time to turn it loose
Beam me up

But don't I make you beam like Scottie?
(Scottie, yeah) eat you like Umami
Put you before anybody, yeah (Yeah)
Used to be my favorite hobby
Why play me? You know my body, yeah
Keep all of your sorry's, yeah
But don't I make you beam like Scottie?
Eat you like Umami
Put you before anybody, yeah (Anybody)
You used to be my favorite hobby
Why play me? You know my body
You can keep all of your sorry's sorry

Dear God, need a real one
Am I asking too much? (Asking too much)
Wish you saw what I see, just one touch
And I felt where you were coming from
We done came way too close to give up
I been calling you, baby, pick up
In your zone
Feeling like I'm Travis or Thug
(Pick up the phone)
We just broke up, how you feel now?
Change my number, I ain't kneeling down
I ain't heal yet but it's still love (Yeah)

Slippery phabo
John Henry phabo
LNF phabo

Never gave a fuck
Coming live from the South side
Niggas better duck, hol' up
Make you so sick, you could throw up (Shit)
