		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah, yeah

Baby, it's 3:00 AM (3:00 AM)
Had you on my mind and it's not the first time
We've gone through this (oh, oh, oh-oh)

Wanting you more and more
I can't help but think of what we could be

(And Baby, if I could tell you)
Baby, if I could tell you, if I could tell you
How much I care, I'm in despair
Are you still there?
(Just tell me)
Just tell me
How we can make this work?
How we can make this work

'Cause baby, if I find a way
I'm sure of it this love won't stray
Just give me a chance to say I love you
I need you
Now are you here to stay
Or fade away like every other day?
You're the reason that I lie awake

Baby, it's 3:00 AM (3:00 AM)
Had you on my mind and it's not the first time
We've gone through this (oh, oh, oh-oh)

Wanting you more and more
I can't help but think of what we could be

(And Baby, if I could tell you)
Baby, if I could tell you, if I could tell you
How much I care, I'm in despair
Are you still there?
(Just tell me)
Just tell me
How we can make this work?
How we can make this work
