		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like MÃ¶tley
Grab me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

Flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
Probably gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
My hopes that you come back again
And tell me everything's
Okay
Babe, yeah

Topanga is hot today
Manson's in the air
And all my friends have come
'Cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to live when absolutely nothing's clear

Life rocked me like Motley
Bad beginning to my new year
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
And how I gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's
Okay
Babe, yeah, yeah

It's fucking hot, hot, winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
It's hot, even for February
Something 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writing in blood on my walls and shit like
Oh, oh my god
Tripping off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me baby
Come on, come on, come on, come on

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine
To take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane
Leaving my old man again
I hope that I'd come back one day
To tell you that I really changed
Baby

It's hot, hot
Something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is that makes my head get crazy
Oh, oh, oh
Makes me feel like I can change
Oh, oh, oh, oh
All of my evil ways and shit
Hmm, hmm
Oh, oh, oh
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
