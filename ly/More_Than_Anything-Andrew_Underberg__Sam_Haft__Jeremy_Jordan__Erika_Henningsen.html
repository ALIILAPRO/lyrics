		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Charlie! You don't understand, Heaven never listens
They didn't listen to me, they won't listen to you

You don't know that!

I do

You didn't know that when I tried this all before
My dreams were too hard to defend
And in the end, I won't lose it all again
Now you're the only thing worth fighting for
More than anything, more than anything
I'll shelter and adore you more than anything

Dad, I don't need you to protect me from this

I just don't want you to be crushed by them like-
Like I was

Dad

When I was young, I didn't really know you at all
I always felt so small
But I heard your stories and I was enthralled
The tales about your lofty dreams, I listened breathlessly
Imagining it could be me
So in the end, it's the view I had of you
That showed me dreams can be worth fighting for
More than anything, more than anything
I need to save my people more than anything

I've been dyin' to find out who you are
I've been waiting, wanting the same thing
Looks like the apple doesn't fall far
Took you a while
I've missed that smile
All that I'm hopin', now that my eyes are open
Is that we can start again, not be pulled apart again
'Cause in the end, you are part of who I am
I'll support your dream, whatever lies in store
And who could ask for more?
More than anything, more than anything
More than anything, more than anything
I'm grateful you're my daughter (father) more than anything
More than anything
