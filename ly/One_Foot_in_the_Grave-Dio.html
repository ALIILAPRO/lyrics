		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go again, must be delirious
Can't close my eyes
Sleep is just a drug, this must be serious
This must be serious
Does this go on and on forever

Sometimes in the dark I feel invincible
I wonder why
I hear voices out of shadows
And shadows never lie

Helter skelter
Now give me shelter
Use the children like toys
Eat your lover
Then find an another
There be good [become] little boys
Boys will be boys

I got two hands to hold you
Two arms around you
The master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you
Two hands to help you
Put one foot in the grave

Here we go again, must be delirious
Can't close my eyes, no
Sleep is just a drug, this must be serious
This must be serious

Helter skelter
Now, give me shelter
My brain is twisting again
I could be dreaming this
No, I'm screaming this
No more, no

I got two hands to hold you
Two arms around you
The master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you
Two hands to help you
Put one foot in the grave
