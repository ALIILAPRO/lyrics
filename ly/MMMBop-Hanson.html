		  Oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah

You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife
Then you turn your back and they're gone so fast
Oh yeah
And they're gone so fast, yeah
Oh
So hold on to the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
And when you get old, start losing your hair
Can you tell me who will still care?
Can you tell me who will still care?
Oh, oh care

Plant a seed, plant a flower, plant a rose
You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows
It's a secret no one knows
Oh-oh, no one knows
