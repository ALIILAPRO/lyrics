		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm speed bumpin' (speed bumpin')
Joyridin' (joyridin')
Sparks flyin', but I'm still part-timin' (but I'm part-timin')
All these long nights (long nights) 
That I'm archivin' (that I'm archivin')
Livin' highlights, but I'm farsighted

Cool if I'm calloused (cool if I'm calloused)
Long as I'm balanced (long as I'm balanced)
Cool if I'm clouded
That's when I'm grounded

When I'm in my lows (when I'm in my)
Really in my lows (really in my)
When I'm in my oms
Really in my oms (in my oms)

You wouldn't catch me dead-set (dead-set)
Bankin' on a best bet (best bet)
Always second-guessin'

Always second-guessin'

(The higher the summer, the harder the fall)

The higher the summer, the harder the fall
The wider we open, the closer the calls
I memorize your number and the creases in your palms
Memorize your number and the creases in your palms

Joyride to Lloyd Wrights, I drive you up the walls
Borrowed apartments with Harvard and Dartmouth
Ivy spread like Peter and Paul
And finally I feel like my faults don't define me at all
Finally, I feel like my faults don't define me at all (at all)
It's all because of you

Denim and deep cuts
Lemonade, peach fuzz
We had the rights to
All the wrong reasons
