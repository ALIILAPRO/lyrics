		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're telling me
That I'm the most important thing to you
But can't you see?
You're killing me with all the things you do
And I really want to believe it's impossible
I really want to believe it's all a dream
But I just can't seem to wake up
I just can't seem to turn on the light
One step off the edge
And the world will seem all right

You did it again,
Yes you in the mirror
You put your faith in a cruel world
All my dead friends come to haunt, harm and hinder, never letting go
Here to drag me down to Hell
Just say goodbye

Just answer me
What was the point of all that treachery
And soon we'll see
The truth behind all of your blasphemy

No never again
I'll never trust no one again
I'd sooner slit my wrists and risk discovery of Hell
Than stay another moment here where certain Devils dwell
