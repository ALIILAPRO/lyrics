		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The black hole 
Of the 
Window 
Where you sleep 

The night breeze 
Carries 
Something sweet 
A peach tree 

Wild women don't get the blues 
But I find that 
Lately I've been crying like a 
Tall child 

So please hurry leave me 
I can't breathe 
Please don't say you love me 
胸がはち切れそうで 

One word from you and I would 
Jump off of this 
Ledge I'm on 
Baby 

Tell me "don't" 
So I can 
Crawl back in 

And I was so young 
When I behaved 
Twenty five 

Yet now I find 
I've grown into 
A tall child 

And I don't wanna go home yet 
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

Please hurry leave me 
I can't breathe 
Please don't say you love me 
胸がはち切れそうで 

One word from you and I would 
Jump off of this 
Ledge I'm on 
Baby 

Tell me "don't" 
So I can 
Crawl back in 

One word from you and I would 
Jump off of this 
Ledge I'm on 
Baby 

Tell me "don't" 
So I can 
Crawl back in
