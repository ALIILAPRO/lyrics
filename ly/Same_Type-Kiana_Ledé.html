		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't a saint or nothin'
But too many niggas wanna take me down
Can't count on my hands, I gotta double up, yeah
Another one for the count
Let's start with my dad
Mean no disrespect
Then to my ex
He made me a mess
And it never ends
Count, count, count 'em up

It's so sad, but it's true
That this shit ain't nothing new, new

Take, take, take, yeah, they take too much
One day blowin' me kisses, then they go missing
Yeah, they gonna hype you up
Trappin' my trust then end up leavin' me
Overcompensated, complicated, fucking jaded
And I don't know why
I try when they all the same type
I try
I try when they all the same type

I seen the good in you
But sometimes bad people do good things and
Can't even see it's cruel
I don't trust how much that I don't trust you
Now anybody move
Think that twistin' and controllin'
Prolly got some morals missin'
And I can't tell who from who, they all

Take, take, take, and they take too much
Runnin' 'round blowin' me kisses, then they go missing
Yeah, they gonna hype you up
Trappin' my trust and end up leavin' me
Overcompensated, contemplated, fucking jaded
And I don't know why
I try when they all the same type
I try when they all the same (hey)
It's the stupid same mistake (hey)
Ain't nobody else to blame (ain't nobody else to blame, yeah)
Ain't nobody else to blame
