		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One look and I saw what I wanted to see
You know that you wrapped my heart
Around your finger so easily, yeah

With your centerfold body going through the moves
Why did I keep wasting the truth for you tonight

I won't be cryin', cryin', when I think about you
'Cause I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'
'Cause those days are gone, gone

Someone twisted you, so you gave it to me
Yeah, you gave it to me good
You're a nightmare everywhere
Disguised as a dream

Well, I got lost, wandering through the darkness
In your maze of lies
Your trapdoor-way right into my insides, but tonight

I won't be cryin', cryin', when I think about you
'Cause I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'

The tears are falling to the floor
But you won't catch me cryin' anymore

I won't be cryin', cryin', when I think about you
'Cause I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'
'Cause those days are gone, gone

I won't be cryin', cryin', when I think about you
'Cause I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'
Those days are gone, gone

Cryin', cryin', when I think about you
'Cause I opened my eyes
And I won't be cryin', cryin'
Those days are gone, gone

Cryin', cryin'
