		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dinosaur)

Whatever happened to humanity?
Yeah, we've driven ourselves to insanity
We are human waste in a race to the finish
Now we know that we're all gonna get it

Do somethin' stupid like some dumbass kids
Hidin' in the dark, huntin' down our friends
We all Lord of Flies 'til the very end
Now we know that we're all gonna get it

Whoa, twenty, twenty-four hours to go

Hey, kids, boys and girls
Now we've really done it, it's the end of the world
'Cause hey, kids, we were warned
Tonight we're goin' out, goin' out like the dinosaur

Hoping heaven gonna let you in
But your god is wonderin' where you've been?
When idiocracy is all there is
Now we know that we're all gonna get it

Carl Sagan rollin' in his grave
We all lie to ourselves sayin' it's just a phase
Yeah, we're all fucked, yeah, we can't be saved
Now we know that we're all gonna get it

Whoa, ten, nine hours to go

Hey, kids, boys and girls
Now we've really done it, it's the end of the world, so
Pray big, oh, my lord
Now we better run, better run
Come with me, now we're free
Let's all just purge the ending
Hey, kids, we were warned
Tonight we're goin' out, goin' out like the dinosaur

Whoa, only one minute to go

Hey, kids, boys and girls
Now we've really done it, it's the end of the world, so
Pray big, oh, my lord
Now we better run, better run
Come with me, now we're free
Let's all just purge the ending
Hey, kids, we were warned
Tonight we're goin' out, goin' out like the dinosaur
Like the dinosaur
