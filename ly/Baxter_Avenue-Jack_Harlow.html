		  (Hol' up)

My dad built houses, my mom painted pictures
They both gave it up once I came into the picture
Me, I'm like them, just a fifty-fifty mixture
My mom rode horses, she wish I had a sister
I prefer the pen to a hammer or a brush
But I build things up and my imagery is lush
I used to play soccer but I never had the touch
Basketball, too, but I ain't love it that much
Much of my time's spent lookin' for a rush
Tryna find somethin' to afford me that feelin'
I fall in love with girls 'cause they physically appealin'
A couple weeks pass and the convos hit a ceilin'
I've smoked a few blunts, Cookies and Runtz
Gotten high enough to know it isn't what I want
Met the celebrities, seen through the fronts
Dated one girl and I've seen two at once
I ain't upset to be inside for some months
And get back in touch with the person that I was
Know I've given too much of my time to the chase
Tryna get in touch with a person that I lust
So this the perfect time to hang it up
Used to sleep until noon now at nine, I'm wakin' up
More time that I'm inside then the less I want to talk
I don't wanna FaceTime, I ain't tryna say, "What's up?"
Careful with the ways that my time is taken up
Bunch of geeks tryna take the shine away from us
Reachin' for critiques and they tryna say I suck
Got me reminiscin' back to a time I gave a
But my skin's gotten thick since then
And my high school crush has done the same thing
So when this blows over and I'm back home
I'ma tell her that I'm really done playin' games
Seven figures on my bank statements
Seven fellas that I'm that stayin' on the same page with
We been shootin' for the stars and our aim's dangerous
Hasn't been a single thing that the gang can't get
My main thing shall remain nameless
Know they ask about her often but I ain't sayin' shit
There's a level of discretion that I'm maintainin'
She don't understand it but she ain't famous
We gon' see who's still around once the game changes
She's a business woman but I got her playin' favorites
You ain't rootin' for me then I gotta make changes
Ex girls watchin' with a lot of fake pages (a lot of fake pages)
My OG showed me what a Plain Jane is
And a bust down is, now I got a hankerin' to spend a few thousand
KY used to take me up to Icebox when he'd get his jewelry cleaned
They would ask if they could help me and I say, "I'm just browsin'"
Juan worked at Enterprise Rentals discounted
Ville to the A and back, we was puttin' miles in
Always wondered to myself if I could really be the leader 
Of a group of brown-skinned boys when I'm not brown-skinned
Certain things they grew up on that they get but I don't get
Differences in how we raised make me feel like I don't fit
Not to mention the distance between our parents' houses
Shared some money with 'em so they know I care about 'em
I'm tryna do it right and figure what a fair amount is
But I fantasize 'bout a day that we all swimmin' in it
No contracts and we independent
Stay close, never start a convo with, "It's been a minute"
'Cause it never will be end of sentence
Nemo, that's my right hand, guides me through my indecisions
Vodka in my left hand takes away my inhibitions
Way too gone but I'm wakin' up in mint condition
Ready for whatever, got the troops with me in position
