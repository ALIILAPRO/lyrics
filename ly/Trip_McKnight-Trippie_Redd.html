		  I wanna, I never heard of them
I wanna see what you guys listen to
Trippie Redd
You know who my favorite band is?
You ever heard of Led Zeppelin?
Ha-ha (haha)
Where your cash at? (yeah, gang)
Big 14, know what the fuck goin' on
Where your motherfuckin' bag at, nigga? (Big 14, bitch)
Ha-ha (1400 or nothin', nigga)
You know what's goin' down
And we gunnin' niggas on gang (bah)

Yeah
Say you got cash, lil' nigga? Then throw it (ha-ha)
You get a bag, lil' nigga, then blow it
I got them racks, lil' bitch, I'ma throw it (yeah, yeah)
Say you got cash, lil' nigga? Then throw it
You have the cash, lil' nigga? Then throw it (say you got cash)
I got them bags, lil' bitch, I'ma throw it (racks)
I'm throwin' that money all out in the open (racks, racks)
I don't give a fuck 'bout money (don't give a fuck, nah)
Nigga get bust 'bout money (nigga get bust)
Lose my trust 'bout money (lose my trust)
You know that bitch can't touch my money (no can't touch)
Big backend, King Tut my money (King Tut)
I know why they act funny (ha-ha)
I know why they act funny (yeah, huh)
I know why they act funny (pussy)

Bitch, I'm a Don and I stick to the code
Sip Don Perignon when I get on the road
Bitch, I'm a villain, my heart hella cold (Cold)
I split Superman, and I get in my mode
With the slatt militia, I'm Commander Cobra
I run the block, I don't need a motive (Motive)
This a McLaren, bae, fuck a Toyota (Toyota)
Grew up with the savages, militants, soldiers
Her pussy got weak, my money got older
You ain't from the block, say you blood, who the donor? (Who the donor?)
'Rari's, Lambs', Corvetties, and Rovers
Stay in the field that and ain't got no clovers
Fuck all the chill, we sendin' in mortars
We poppin' these niggas like muhfuckin' boils (yeah)
Bitch, I got money like I own oil
Got it out of the mud (yeah), got it out of the soil
They send 'em like Johnny, aluminum foil
And I'm still on they ass, I ain't keepin' it cordial (bitch)
I'm down to cool shit, I done traveled through portals
I ain't never been scared of no motherfuckin' mortal
I throw all the cash, my money immortal
Bitch, I'm a killer like Roronoa Zoro (yeah)
Keep me a rubber like Luffy
Yeah, that my brother like Ace and Sabo
We smoke the opps down 'til they doobies

Oh, shit, yeah
I just put the mornin' sun on my wrist (on my wrist)
Ayy, put my wrist up to the stars, it eclipse (it eclipse)
Take a hunnid to the strip club, fuck it, I throw all of this shit (shit)

Yeah
Say you got cash, lil' nigga? Then throw it (say you got cash, ha-ha)
You get a bag, lil' nigga, then blow it
I got them racks, lil' bitch, I'ma throw it (yeah, yeah)
Say you got cash, lil' nigga? Then throw it (say you got cash)
You have the cash, lil' nigga? Then throw it
I got them bags, lil' bitch, I'ma throw it (racks)
I'm throwin' that money all out in the open (racks, racks)
I don't give a fuck 'bout money (don't give a fuck, nah)
Nigga get bust 'bout money (nigga get bust)
Lose my trust 'bout money (lose my trust)
You know that bitch can't touch my money (don't touch)
Big backend, King Tut my money (King Tut)
