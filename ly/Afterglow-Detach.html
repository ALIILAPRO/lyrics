		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know how many times?
I've listened the silence and heard you there
How many times?

Tell me how to play with trembling snakes
Show me how to draw pain human takes
For the last time (last time)
No reason to pray

God is sick today
God is sick today

How can I hide this afterglow? 
Godforsaken home
Let me bleed it out
What can I find in hollow room for sick disgrace?
Let me bleed it out

And here is the time, when I'm going to dwell
My personal, personal, personal hell
Where nothing is fine, this coldest place
With demons face to face

Self-revolution clear
Tragedy ending for those who confessed
Maybe life is nothing more
Curse inside
Inside the blessed 
Inside the blessed

How can I hide this afterglow? 
Godforsaken home
Let me bleed it out
What can I find in hollow room for sick disgrace?
Let me bleed it out

(Let me bleed, let me bleed it out)
Now hear my absolution
I wanted you to know one thing
You're so sick, so fucking sick today
(Let me bleed, let me bleed it out)
Now hear my absolution
I wanted you to know one thing
You're so sick, so fucking sick today
