		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting for a letter, giving me a reason why
Think I know ya better never been the first to write 
I could make it easy for ya , shake the olive tree and hold it
Out so we can move on , put it all behind 

I built a house and the walls were 100 feet tall
Locked all the windows and doors, and I cant hear a sound

Maybe I could still pretend like its all the same 
Like I never fall apart when I hear your name 

No I don't deserve it 

Maybe trying is a thousand letters long 
When your words dry up in a fading sun

Hope that it was worth it 

Tell me all your stories, I don't have to sleep tonight
Know that I believe em, still a little girl inside 
You could make it easy for me, tell me that you never think 
About the smell of jasmine, all we had was time 

You built a house and the walls were 100 feet tall
Knocked on the windows and doors, but youre too damn proud 

Maybe I could still pretend like its all the same 
Like I never fall apart when I hear your name 

No I dont deserve it 

Maybe sorry is a thousand letters long 
When your words dry up in a fading sun

Hope that it was worth it
