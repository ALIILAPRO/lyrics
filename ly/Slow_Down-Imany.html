		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow down
Take your time
It will be alright
If you decide to take it on the science
Take it easy
Take it easy

Oh slow down
Take your time
It will be alright
If you decide to take it on the science
Take it easy
Take it easy

Oh slow down

And I understand
Why fazing a friend
It's so hard, sometimes
But guess what
You're not the only one
The door is shot
But so is your mind
[x2]

Slow down
Take your time
It will be alright
If you decide to take it on the science
Take it easy
Take it easy

Oh slow down
Take your time
It will be alright
If you decide to take it on the science
Take it easy
Take it easy

Oh slow down

But let me explain you
Don't have to complain
Look at the bright side
Open your eyes
Along with your mind
It's not so bad
God is love and love is all around

You do the best you can
Doesn't have to be grand
Open your arms
Now is the time
To get on with your life
Hold on
Mend your heart and enjoy the ride

Slow down
Take your time
It will be alright
If you decide to take it on the science
Take it easy
Take it easy

Oh slow down
Take your time
It will be alright
If you decide to take it on the science
Take it easy
Take it easy

Oh slow down
