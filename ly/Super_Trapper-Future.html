		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The top come off the Lamb 'cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert, I'm a super trapper

I came up from out the 'partments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
911 Turbo Porsche 'cause I'm a super trapper
Young Pluto is out the trenches but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Tryna sabotage my crew? Boy, you a swagger jacker
911 Turbo Porsche 'cause I'm a super trapper

Rags to riches, fuck these snitches I ain't scared, bruh
Cold and sheisty, put some prices on your head
I'm a product of the young nigga with dreads, yeah
And my left wrist cost a bird, I'm on Tropicana servin'
Shawty unsure, hope he don't do no sherm
Came from out the Kirk, made myself a don
I gotta do payroll, my check on Jose Canseco
First class Saint Tropez ho, you do whatever I say so

The top come out the Lamb 'cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
Two door Maybach on the schedule that's the latest
Hard top 'Rari, Double R, that Mercedes

I came up from out the 'partments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
911 Turbo Porsche 'cause I'm a super trapper
Young Pluto is out the trenches but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Tryna sabotage my crew? Boy, you a swagger jacker
911 Turbo Porsche 'cause I'm a super trapper

All these foreigns got me lookin' inconsiderate
All these exotic bitches got me like a racist
I just throw that in the safe and then count it
My tennis bracelets lookin' like a water fountain
I got Benjamins, they taller than a mountain
I was pushing dope and then hired an accountant
Lamborghini, I say Lamb when I pronounce it
The doors gon' lift up in the air and it's so spacious

I came up from out the 'partments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
911 Turbo Porsche 'cause I'm a super trapper
Young Pluto is out the trenches, but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Tryin' to sabotage my crew? Boy you a swagger jacker
911 Turbo Porsche 'cause I'm a super trapper

I'll raise ya 'bout that fettuccine then some
Told her meet me at the boat, I'm in Nassau
I still will push the line, nigga, Julius Peppers
Keep money on my mind, got a bad temper
Paid cash, it's very hard for me to do rentals
I can't hate ya 'cause I faked it 'til I made it too
Sober lady, you betrayed and got deflated 
I'm trying pick this year who bitch who gonna be my lady 
I got bitches, different flavor, this one Cajun
I'ma pimp her and her sister, I'm her favorite
Keep it cordial with these niggas 'cause they traders
I'm on Molly and it's pink like it's Ms. Piggy, yeah 

The top come out the Lamb 'cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert, I'm a super trapper
Two door Maybach on the schedule that's the latest
Hard top 'Rari, Double R, that Mercedes
The top come out the Lamb 'cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert, I'm a super trapper
Two door Maybach on the schedule that's the latest
