		  (Just can't believe this, man)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissin' wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby, all that I can say (all that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing (hey)
And don't come back to me (come back to me)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, 21
Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link?
Got you ridin' 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers
Girl, you used to ride in the rinky dink
I'm the one put you in Eliantte (on God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (on God)
You was rockin' Coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'
Side bitch in Frisco, I call her my Bay-bae (21)
I got a girl, but I still feel alone (on God)
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home (on God)
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone (21)
Can't even record, you got me out my zone

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

If you creepin', just don't let me find out (on God)
Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house (on God)
If you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me
