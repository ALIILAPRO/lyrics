		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you opened the door, now there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I 
Am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I 
Am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh oh

But baby you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I 
Am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier
