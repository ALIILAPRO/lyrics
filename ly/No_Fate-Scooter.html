		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Going back into time
Lying through the night
Remember, when it just took all over
Taking me higher
Thoughts in my mind
On the roof
Uplifting
I'm drifting, away
From city to city
From dawn to dawn
And the whole generation is on the rock
Goodbye to the past 
Hello to the future
As the struggle continues
There's no fate

Someones going to ask you about the truth
And the meaning
Expecting, another answer
To be sure he's on the right side 
And your on the wrong
Do not listen
It's your decision
From face to face
From soul to soul
And the whole generation is out of control
Goodbye to the past 
Hello to the future
As the struggle continues
There's no fate

There's no fate

There's no fate

There's no fate

From city to city
From dawn to dawn

From face to face
From soul to soul
As the struggle continues
There's no fate

There's no fate
