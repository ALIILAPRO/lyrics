		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say don't trust
You, me, we, us
So we'll walk
We must
'Cause of you, me
And it's all about
It's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'Cause you know us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'Cause you know us

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
And no-one can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

If they hurt you
They hurt me, too
So we'll rise up
Won't stop
And it's all about
It's all about

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'Cause you know us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'Cause you know us

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
And no-one can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us

They don't know
They can't see
Who we are
Fear is the enemy
Hold on tight, hold on to me
'Cause tonight

It's all about us
It's all about, all about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'Cause you know us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
There's a theme that they can't touch
'Cause you know us

It's all about us, all about us
It's all about, all about us
All about us
Run away if we must
'Cause you know us

It's all about us (it's all about us)
It's all about us (it's all about us)
And no-one can trust (it's all about us)
It's all about us
It's all about us
