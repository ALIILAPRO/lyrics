		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

Green eyes, fried rice
I could cook an egg on you
Late night, game time
Coffee on the stove, yeah
You're sweet ice cream
But you could use a Flake or two
Blue bubblegum twisted 'round your tongue

I don't want you to get lost
I don't want you to go broke
I want you

It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
Know I love you, babe

Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

Excuse me, green tea
Music for a sushi restaurant
From ice on rice
Scuba-duba-do-boo-boo
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for a sushi restaurant
Music for whatever you want
Scuba-duba-do-boo-boo

I'm not going to get lost
I'm not going to go broke
Staying cool
(Know I love you, babe)

Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba

If the stars were edible
And our hearts were never full
Could we live with just a taste?
Just a taste

It's 'cause I love you, babe
In every kind of way
Just a little taste
Know I love you, babe

Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
(You know I love you, babe)
Ba, ba-ba
Ba-ba, ba-ba
