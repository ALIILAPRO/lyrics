		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been thinking about this all night
All week saying this was right
Cross your heart and hope to die
Are you sure you wanna pay the price?
Do it outside in the night
'Cause where you going is the life

When I'm looking in your face
(Oh, higher, higher)
You give me faith
(Oh, high up in the sky)
I feel this faith
(Oh, higher, higher)
This must be fate
(Oh, high up in the sky)
What do I know?

Saying that you wanna know
What it feels like to let go
Everything that was before
Should you do it in the youth?
Be enlightened, feel the truth
Let the serotonin settle leaves

When I'm looking in your face
(Oh, higher, higher)
You give me faith
(Oh, high up in the sky)
I feel this faith
(Oh, higher, higher)
This must be fate
(Oh, high up in the sky)
What do I know?

I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
To look in your eyes when you see the vision
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
To look in your eyes when you see the vision
Late night (Late night), decisions (decisions)
Do you wanna (do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)
Late night (Late night), decisions (decisions)
Do you wanna (do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)
Late night (Late night), decisions (decisions)
Do you wanna (do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)
Late night (Late night), decisions (decisions)
Hello (Hello) spirit
Blast off

Hold on tight, hold on for life
If this is what you like
Do it all night
Girl, I don't gotta fly
I just wanna ride
Back and forth, left and right
Ain't tryna be slick
But I just wanna slide
Or I can be a kite
And I can just fly
Away with the birds
Call sky
High, high, high, high
Backroad trails, follow the line
Coming from, still birds in the sky (Oh yeah)
Bunch of horses herd in the sky
Stare too long, you'll be hurting your eye
How does it feel to be on this side?
The sunshine, the all-seeing eye
Like ayy, like a lightning strike
Melting your body and up through your mind
And into your spirit, and your spirit does glide
Floating high, idling high
Away into the light
How 'bout we just fly? Here for a dime
Again

When I'm looking in your face
(Oh, higher, higher)
You give me faith
(Oh, high up in the sky)
I feel this faith
(Oh, higher, higher)
This must be fate
(Oh, high up in the sky)
What do I know?
