		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the studio, I know my shawty in love with me
We get away for the night, coz I know she gone run with me
She said I don't want to fight, so I give her my company
I know she feeling the vibe, when I'm walking in suddenly
I'm the studio, I know my shawty in love with me
We get away for the night, coz I know she gone run with me
She said I don't want to fight, so I give her my company
I know she feeling the vibe, when I'm walking in suddenly
I know you feeling the vibes
Shawty come hop in the ride
You know I'm a thief in the night
I can show you the way of a sign
Or we can go back into time
Where the stars in the sky, they align
Tell nobody, your secrets are mine, aye aye
Under the moonlight, I got baby she setting the mood right, hey
Tell me what you like, if you need it get for you like, hey
I don't want to see you down
But I gotta see you going up, when I'm not around
We taking over the town
Shawty wanna be so nasty nasty
I'm telling her she way too classy
But she wanna sit in the back seat back seat
Now she got me going round thru the back street
Now she got me going down inside
I'm on the way, baby look in the sky
I feel the same when i look in your eyes
Let's take a trip, we be doing it high, yeah oh yeah
I'm the studio, I know my shawty in love with me
We get away for the night, coz I know she gone run with me
She said I don't want to fight, so I give her my company
I know she feeling the vibe, when I'm walking in suddenly
I'm the studio, I know my shawty in love with me
We get away for the night, coz I know she gone run with me
She said I don't want to fight, so I give her my company
I know she feeling the vibe, when I'm walking in suddenly
