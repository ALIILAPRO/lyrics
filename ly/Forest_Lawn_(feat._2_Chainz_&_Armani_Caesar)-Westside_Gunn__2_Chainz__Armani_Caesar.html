		<p>
		  Ayo, ayo

I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave

Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
Four pound automatic
Turn one to three, I'm talking magic (I'm talking magic)
My Telfar saggin' (My Telfar saggin')
See through Margiella mask with the matte tip
Everybody wish they was this
Jumpsuit was undercover, got the best work on my mother
Take one hit, I bat his brother
Got five runners for the summer, they gon' bring me all that
I'ma buy guns for you suckers, I'ma buy more Johnny Dang
Two hundred rounds, watch that thing hang
I'ma shoot out the sun roof, gloves on, Alexander Wang
Y'all keep acting like y'all ain't shit, y'all ain't shit
Y'all be lusting on IG, I fucked that bitch
I got money on money, I could get you killed
All my niggas got bodies, 223s gon' split yo' shit

I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave

My fork got stamina, arm and a hammer
Now I'ma get rich in this bitch
My money so tall, like wood on some stilts
So tippy-toe, hopping the fence
I pop in ya, popping my wrist
Mention my name when you pull out the list
I lead the score, a couple assists
I'm in a foreign surrounded my bricks
You on the floor surrounded by sticks
You want some more, you gonna get it
On 22s, a word to Emmitt
When I'm in first, your foes defend me
Coming in first, you folks offend me
I'm in the Rolls, no first amendment
I close the gap, I told my dentist
I used to trap next door to Wendy's
I-I got 'em tweaking now (Tweaking now)
Probably no sleeping now (Sleeping now)
I pop with the beacon, you know what I'm speaking
With gasoline seeping out (Fuck that shit, boy)
Extendo is peeking out, the lookout is peeking out
You know I ain't preaching, mama, my mental
They gotta come see me now, Tony

I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave
I take these words to my grave, can't nobody fuck with me
I take these words to my grave, I take these words to my grave

'Mani Ceas', the dame with the gang
Griselda the crew, we the clip with the wave
Boss bitch, queen of my lane
Been running it up like I'm getting in shape
Fuck it, I just gave my own self a raise
Which one I'ma cop, Bentley or Wraith?
Mic'in 'em both just to play in they face
Tell them white bitches to stay in they place
These rappers, get 'em so aggy
It ain't respected unless a bitch at me
Armani's closet, fit got him gagging
You in designer, still looking tacky
My chain on Johnny Dang, my bank account put these niggas to shame
You doing spreads with all of them 20s
Please put them lil bitty racks away, woo
Upping sticks, while I'm up in dicks
While you suckin' dick, I be stuffing bricks
Boss bitch, and I'm fucking rich
Wish I would be pressed 'bout another bitch
Saint Laurent, it ain't even out yet
I ain't shopping at no fucking outlet
In Milan with my hands outstretched
Living room with Versace couch sets

Ain't that the word on the street?
FLYGOD has the best shit
