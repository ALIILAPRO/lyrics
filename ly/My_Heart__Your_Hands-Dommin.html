		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel the knife carving
Your love in my heart
You promised you wouldn't
Harm a hair
On this fragile body
No that's not fair

But how can I trust you
How can I trust you

With my heart in your hands
Closing your grip
With my heart in your hands
Closing your grip
I'm so afraid that you'll leave me cold
With my heart in your hands closing

Try to sit here with closed eyes
It's impossible
'Cause how will I know
That you'll be good
Doing the things that you know you should

Yeah, how can I trust you
How can I trust you

With my heart in your hands
Closing your grip
With my heart in your hands
Closing your grip
I'm so afraid that you'll leave me cold
With my heart in your hands closing your

How can I trust you
How can I trust you

Oooh
With my heart in your hands
Closing your grip
With my heart in your hands
Closing your grip
I'm so afraid that you'll leave me cold
With my heart in your hands closing
Your grip
Your grip
Your grip, yeah, yeah
