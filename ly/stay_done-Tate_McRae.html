		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh

Hate that I'm always gonna have a side to me
That's still in awe when you're mad at me
You can't do it wrong in my eyes
I hate it that you gotta break something
To realize we're at rock bottom
But kill me again 'cause the high's twice as high
Wish this bullshit would end, but we're back here again

Yeah, I know we should break up
But I just can't stay done with you, you
When I take off my makeup
Go to bed, wanna wake up with you, you
We're best friends and enemies
We're good 'til you're dead to me, yeah
I told you goodbye like
Hundred million times
I know I sound so dumb
But I just can't stay done with you
I just can't stay done with you

I hate it that I'm tryna call you up
When you're the thing that I'm running from
The one-way street I can't get off, oh yeah
I've been nothing less than cordial
But if we're really talking morals
Why'd you have to hit her up like that?
You should know it isn't normal

Yeah, I know we should break up
But I just can't stay done with you, you
When I take off my makeup
Go to bed wanna wake up with you, you
We're best friends and enemies
We're good 'til you're dead to me, yeah
I told you goodbye like
Hundred million times
I know I sound so dumb
But I just can't stay done with you
I just can't stay done with you

I just can't stay done with you
I just can't stay done with you
