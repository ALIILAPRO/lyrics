		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good morning, son
I am a bird
Wearing a brown polyester shirt
You want a Coke?
Maybe some fries?
The roast beef combo's only nine ninety five
But it's okay
You don't have to pay
I've got all the change

Everybody knows
It hurts to grow up
And everybody does
It's so weird to be back here
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting it
We're still fighting it

And you're so much like me
I'm sorry

Good morning, son
Twenty years from now
Maybe we'll both sit down
And have a few beers
And I can tell
You 'bout today
And how I picked you up
And everything changed
It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things

Everybody knows
It sucks to grow up
And everybody does
It's so weird to be back here
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting it
We're still fighting it

You'll try and try
And one day you'll fly
Away from me

(Good morning, son)
(Good morning, son)
(Good morning, son)
(Good morning, son)
Good morning, son
(Good morning, son)
I am a bird
(Good morning, son)
(Good morning, son)

It was pain
Sunny days and rain
I knew you'd feel the same things

Everybody knows
It hurts to grow up
And everybody does
It's so weird to be back here
Let me tell you what
The years go on and
We're still fighting it
We're still fighting it, oh
We're still fighting it
We're still fighting it

And you're so much like me
I'm sorry
