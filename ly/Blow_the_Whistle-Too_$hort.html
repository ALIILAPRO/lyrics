		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have super powers
Rap 225 thousand hours
Get it calculated, do the math
I made a thousand songs that made you move your ass
And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
Two singers and ten comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word? Bitch
Why they gotta say it like $hort? Bitch
You know they can't play on my court
Can't hang with the big dogs, stay on the porch

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Where you get that from?
Grab the mic, spit one, let me hit that blunt
Pimp-c, 8-Ball and MJG
Keep spittin' that P to the I.M.p
Bun-b, that's Texas, baby
Ball and G, that's Memphis, baby
$Hort Dog, that's Oakland, baby
Ain't nothin' but pimpin' these days, G
My nigga C got locked up
But these real hoes still know they gots to fuck
Give a fuck, what you say
$Hort Dog fuck with UGK
Do you really wanna be like me?
Spit game like Snoop and T.I.p
Pretty girls in the V.I.p
They came with Dre, they don't need ID

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle

Your mind is gone, your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Poppin' pills, it goes down for real
Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country come back and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York and ATL
Houston and L.A., ask Dave Chappelle
About my rich bitch, he got her from me
And made 50 million dollars, I'm proud of you D
But I'm crazy, you don't wanna be like me
I come from East Oakland where the youngstas get hyphy
Blow it

Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Blow the whistle
Bitch

Too $hort
Up all night, baby
Album number 16
Y'all can't fuck with that
