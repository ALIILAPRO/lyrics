		  Stileto – Dead or Alive:
Verse 1:
What did I do, fallin’ for you
Fucked up my life, you messed it up like two hundred times
Baby it’s sad, but now I can laugh
You’ve had your fun, now you’ll be getting a taste of my love
Pre:
So now I’m asking you for one last favor
You’ve got an enemy inside your blood
Could you just take this little party favor
It’s just a little present from my love
Chorus:
Tell me your lies, no need to hide
Baby tonight I’ll take you dead or alive
Get you alone, and under control
Cause you’ll be mine
Dead or alive
Verse 2:
I was in pain, you were to blame
Needed the rush, now I’m just runnin’ on coffee and drugs
This hell of a ride, crash to the ground
No one can save you, baby I’m counting you down
Pre:
So now I’m asking you for one last favor
You’ve got an enemy inside your blood
Could you just take this little party favor
It’s just a little present from my love
Chorus:
Tell me your lies, no need to hide
Baby tonight I’ll take you dead or alive
Get you alone, and under control
Cause you’ll be mine
Dead or alive
