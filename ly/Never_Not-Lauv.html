		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
Lost myself, seventeen
Then you came, found me
No other magic could ever compare

There's a room
In my heart with the memories we made
Took 'em down but they're still in their frames
There's no way I could ever forget, mm

For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one
And no matter whatever I do
Ooh, mm
I will never not think about you

What we had only comes
Once in a lifetime
For the rest of mine, I'll always compare

To the room
In my heart with the memories we made
Nights on Fifth, in between B and A
There's no way I could ever forget, mm

For as long as I live and as long as I love
I will never not think about you
You, mm
I will never not think about you
From the moment I left, I knew you were the one
And no matter whatever I do
Ooh, mm
I will never not think about you

Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun, looking back?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun, looking back?
Didn't we have fun?
Didn't we have fun?

We were so beautiful
We were so tragic
No other magic could ever compare
