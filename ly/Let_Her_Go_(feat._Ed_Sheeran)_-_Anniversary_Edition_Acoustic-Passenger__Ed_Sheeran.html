		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feelin' low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go

Starin' at the bottom of your glass
Hopin' one day you'll make a dream last
Dreams come slow and go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feelin' low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Starin' at the ceilin' in the dark
Same old empty feelin' in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well, you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and dived too deep

Well, you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feelin' low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go, oh
And you let her go, oh
Will you let her go?

Well, you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feelin' low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go

Well, you only need the light when it's burnin' low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feelin' low
Only hate the road when you're missin' home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go
