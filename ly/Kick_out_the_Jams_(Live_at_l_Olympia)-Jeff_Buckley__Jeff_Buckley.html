		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna kick 'em out

Well I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby
Cause we all got in tune
When the dressing room got hazy now, baby

I know how you want it, child,
Hot, sweet, and tight
The girls can't stand it
When you're doing it right
When they're up on the stand
And then they kick out the jams, yes
Kick out the jams, I like to kick 'em out

Yes I'm starting to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet
What a feeling
And the sound that abounds and
Resounds and rebounds off the ceiling
You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
When you get the feeling
You've got the sounds above
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jams
Yes, kick out the jams, got to kick 'em out

So you got to get it up
And then can't get enough
That's what
Cause it gets in your brain
It drives you insane, makes you crazy
The, the faster you funk
If you want to feed my rocket
Till the morning comes
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jams
Yes kick out the jams
I done kick 'em out
