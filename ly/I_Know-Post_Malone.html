		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our love will never be another
You're just a devil undercover
Found you when you were in the gutter
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker, shout out Jonas Brothers
I learned more than I cared to discover
Don't you know that I'm more than a come up
You act up and then act like it's nothin'
Sold your soul, you stone cold, you a stunner

Every time you left, shit was never right
In another bed every single night
Had it to a science, you were so precise
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is
Somethin' I can't explain

I know you could never be my bitch
Shit could never be like this
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans
Hundred times you blew another chance
I know you were gettin' down on the low
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this
You could never be my bitch
No, no

Our love will never be another (uh)
You're just a devil undercover (undercover)
Found you when you were in the gutter (in the gutter)
Shit was sweet until I was a sucker ('til I was a sucker)
Rather be single for life (single for life, rather be single)
Then be fuckin' with you
I ain't rollin' the dice, no (rollin' the dice)
I ain't playin' to lose (no)

Everytime you left, shit was never right (no)
In another bed every single night (uh)
Had it to a science, you were so precise
See it in your eyes, saw you in the light
Somehow, mami, I still want you
Listen to me, don't drive away (don't drive away)
Kill me softly, your hold on me is
Somethin' I can't explain

I know you could never be my bitch
Shit could never be like this (be like this)
I know, stop thinkin' you're in my plans
Hundred times you blew another chance (blew another chance)
I know you were gettin' down on the low
Then runnin' back to me in the morning
I know shit could never be like this (be like this)
You could never be my bitch
No, no

Be my bitch
It could never be like this
Shit could never be like this
It could never be like this
