		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've taken all my pain away
And gave me shiny chains
You've taken all my doubts away
Replaced it with this shame
You took away all my problems
Yeah, you bet
And then you gave me a brand new set

And now I'm not afraid

I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

I thought I would ride the high so high until I can't be reached
By gravity
You won't catch me
Won't catch me
Everyone except me
But I soon realized
The rules apply to me I'm sorely mistaken
Aching now
Takin' out
All my rage

And now I'm not afraid

I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
