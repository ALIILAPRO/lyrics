		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'll treat her like a lady
She tell all her friends I go crazy, hey
She just here for temporary love
So sincere, hopin' I care
Just enough (ha, ha)
Just enough (ha)
Just enough (ha, ha)
Just enough (ha)

Uh, I'ma say some cliche shit like
Drive it up inside, then I beat it like a slave
Swimming, backstrokes give you whiplash
Fucking like you wanna have kids but the ah so big
Got you running from the shots like zig-zag
Every time I zip past, zip it down down, quick fast
Zip it up up, slim fast, protein
I finished then I asked, "baby girl, where the hell it go?"
You say, you swallowed the whole thing
I paused 'cause I'm speechless, you be on that freak shit
Nowadays every good girl is the freak bitch
Every time I skin in the quilt with the sheets hit
Surf, swim, swim but I never get seasick
Bullshit seepin' from the mouths of the other niggas
That's why you be sayin', "fuck them niggas"
That's why you be calling me complaining
Then pull up, skrrt, to fuck a nigga
Hey, sucker nigga wherever you are, stay away from her
She don't want you no more, she got a new dog
The difference 'tween me is she know what it is
And no one in love, so you know we lower the risk, it's like

Maybe I'll treat her like a lady
She tell all her friends I go crazy, hey
She just here for temporary love
So sincere, hopin' I care just enough
She say she want the quick dick, talk about a quick fix
She was just sick-sick, now she feel fine (just enough)
Quick dick, talk about a quick fix
I don't bring stress, I ain't tryna make her mine (just enough)
Quick dick, talk about a quick fix
She was just sick-sick, now she feel fine (just enough)
Quick dick, talk about a quick fix
I don't bring stress, I ain't tryna make her mine
We got

This is a lot of shit allotted
I wish to the thots we did that we thotted
But I missed what we would be
But if I'm being honest
I'm tryna stay on track
I'm movin' like I'm Thomas
And if I make a promise
I promise this the truth
I never tell a lie
Like other niggas do
And if I make you boo
It's coming with a "who?"
'Cause the likelihood it is

It's over me and you
I try to stay away
From things that make say
The things that I'm not
'Cause I ain't tryna play
Myself or maybe you
So keep it casual
'Cause casualties is worse
And I rather feed the thirst

Maybe I'll treat her like a lady
She tell all her friends I go crazy, hey
She just here for temporary love
So sincere, hopin' I care just enough
She say she want the quick dick, talk about a quick fix
She was just sick-sick, now she feel fine (just enough)
Quick dick, talk about a quick fix
I don't bring stress, I ain't tryna make her mine (just enough)
Quick dick, talk about a quick fix
She was just sick-sick, now she feel fine (just enough)
Quick dick, talk about a quick fix
I don't bring stress, I ain't tryna make her mine
We got
