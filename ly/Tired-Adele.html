		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stayed behind?
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching, hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back

Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

(I should have known)

"Never mind" said your open arms
I couldn't help believe it tricked me back into them
Even though

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what? And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back

Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back 
(I'm fed up of) And for what? (Biding your time)
And for what? And for what?
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired
