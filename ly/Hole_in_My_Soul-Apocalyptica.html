		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's getting dark and I'm lost in the woods
I'd find a way out if I knew where to look
If I could, I'd rip this page out of my book
I'm confused and misguided and my faith is beside me

I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a thorn in my heart and it's killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be

A fire inside but my bloods turning cold
I'm walking alone down this desolate road
Yesterday feels like a life time ago
The memories are fading, my dreams are all changing

I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
There's a thorn in my heart and it's killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be

There's a hole in my heart, in my life, in my way
And it's filled with regret and all I did, to push you away
If there's still a place in your life, in your heart for me
I would do anything, so don't ask me to leave

I've got a hole in my soul where you use to be
You're the thorn in my heart and you're killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
I wish that I'd treated you differently
'Cause now there's a hole in my soul where you use to be
