		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It came upon a midnight clear
That glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold
"Peace on the earth, good will to men
From heaven's all gracious king"
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing

For lo, the days are hastening on
By prophet bards foretold
When with the ever-circling years
Comes 'round the age of gold

When peace shall over all the earth
It's ancient splendors fling
And our whole world give back the song
Which now the angels sing
