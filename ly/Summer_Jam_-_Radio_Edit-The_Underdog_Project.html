		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And this ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronze skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey, oh, hey
Summer jam, alright
Hey, oh, hey

Tonight, hotties wearin' Prada skirts
Real tight, temperature is risin'
Feelin' real hot in the heat of the night

Midnight, the party won't stop until' the mornin' light
I'm scopin' out the hotties with the light eyes
Be with me tonight

Can't get you outta my mind
I can't lie
'Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waiting for the day to make you mine
'Cause I can't take it

And this ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronze skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey, oh, hey
Summer jam, alright
Hey, oh, hey

Moonlight cruisin' down the boulevard
Strobe lights watchin' you, your body's tight
Alright, looking kinda freaky to me

Can't get you out of my mind
I can't lie
'Cause a girl like you is so hard to find
I'm waitin' for the day to make you mine
'Cause I can't take it

And this ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronze skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothin' but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey, oh, hey
Summer jam, alright
Hey, oh, hey

And this ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronze skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can

And this ain't nothin' but a summer jam
Bronze skin and cinnamon tans, whoa
This ain't nothing but a summer jam
We're gonna party as much as we can
Hey, oh, hey
Summer jam, alright
Hey, oh, hey
Summer jam, alright
