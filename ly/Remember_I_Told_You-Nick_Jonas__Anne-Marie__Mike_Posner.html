		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember I told you, I need you?
Remember the spotlight was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?
I've been looking for lovin', all the wrong places
You too? You too?

I don't like the way you went ant told me, "Oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?

Remember I told you, I need you?
Remember the spotlight was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, and that's cool
And I hope that she gives you, all the things that you deserve
That's true, that's true (listen)

I don't like the way you went ant told me, "Oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, and that's cool

Remember I told you, I need you?
Remember the spotlight was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

Had to cut it off, and we know why
I'm in love with myself, cold inside
Too many shoes in your closet, go some miles
I suck at talking to girls, here goes a try
More women than I should've in a century
Bitches on the side like a Kennedy
Started to drain all my energy
I love it, shoot the friend and an enemy
At the same time, and I can't lie
Too many girls for the way I rock the bassline
You got addicted to the seats on the bassline
Let's see how you do with your back before fame lie
After all the shit we been through
I play the Roxy, I ain't 'bout to guest list you
And I know I'm talking shit, it ain't fair
Hate's just a fancy way saying that I care

Remember I told you, I need you?
Remember the spotlight was there
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care" (saying I care)

Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spotlight was there
All of the words that I'm saying (words I'm saying)
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care" (saying I care)
