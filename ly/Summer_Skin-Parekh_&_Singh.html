		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My summer skin. Is growing thin. How I need the remedy. Winter is creeping in. I can taste the gravity. When it gets cold. 

I need someone to comfort me.

Every time I close my eyes. I can see possibilities. A different place, a different life. The dream that never sleeps. When I feel blue. 

I need someone to love me.

Not the kind of love. That never grows. Although it seems tough. You've go to let it go. Now I'll never know. How to ease your soul. 

My summer skin. Is growing thin. How I need the remedy. Winter is creeping in. I can taste the gravity. When it gets cold. 

I need someone to comfort me. 

Feels like I'm ready to say goodbye. To the only love I ever had in my life. There's no Beatles song that could change my mind. Yes I'm ready to say goodbye. And as I gaze up at the night sky. I ponder the momentariness of life. There's no Woody Allen film that could slow down time. Oh time, time's a waste of life.
