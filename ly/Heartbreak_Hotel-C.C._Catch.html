		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, will make a high class fool
Oh takes your heart and break the rules
Oh, touch your heart
Oh, touch tour soul

Years may come and years may go
Oh heart is high - the heart is low
It's strange and sometimes it makes you blue
'Cause breaking up, it's hard to do

We are livin'
We are livin' in a heartbreak hotel
I'm feeling there's no love you can say
I'm shooting from my heart

Shadows of the dark
We're livin' and we're lost without love
We're living' in a heartbreak hotel
Anyone who has a heart, oh can tell

The eyes of a child
Are weak and are wild
We are livin' in a heartbreak hotel
Love will keep you always young

Oh you have sorrows, you have fun
Oh, touch your heart
Oh, touch your soul
More you live the more you love, oh see

The stars on the sky above
It's strange and sometimes it makes you blue
'Cause breaking up it's hard to do
