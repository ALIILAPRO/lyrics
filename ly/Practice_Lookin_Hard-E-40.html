		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1] 
Bloody murder, crime, drugs, folks smokin' 
Man I remember when it used to be cool to leave ya screen door open 
And let the mosquitos and the flies sneak in 
Look mama and them play whistle 
So I'ma play tackle football with my friends 
I guess them times is gone cause like a wishbone 
I wish I had em' back instead of watchin' brothers fiz-all 
Catch em' out on every track, bar, street, boulevards 
Sweet avenues with dead ends, neighborhoods with antens 
Whatever happened to the days of Little League 
Pop Warner and Boy Scouts, the Old Singing Boys Club 
Voodoo to go to school not thinkin' 
Too busy smokin' weed, sellin' dope and drinkin' 
I guess we're livin' in the last days 
Cause in the last days the Bible speaksof AIDS 
Plagues, brothers killin' brothers, earthquakes 
Youngsters tryin' to earn stripes as a work face 
I'll be a sucker if I don't pull ya ho card 
I used to be soft but now I'm hard 
Fuckin' nigga, I practice lookin' hard 

[Hook] 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Mirror, mirror make the call 
Who's the hardest of them all 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 

[Verse 2] 
Take yo mean face off partner why ya muggin' me 
Fools say shit, I can't help that shit's in me 
It's automatic cause what's mine ain't even took 
It's my mad at the world look 
I said I feel ya man, sometimes I catch myself too 
Mean muggin' folks that did no harm to me or my crew 
But now it shouldn't have to be this way 
Fools say, I don't care what nobody say 
The other man got me this way 
I'm fresh out the pen and out the system for years 
Been fillin' out all kinds of applications to make a grip 
But I don't know nothin' about no computer chip 
It takes that to make a J-O-B in the 93 
But a J-O-B in 93 consists of paper rarely 
Jobs like the oil refinery 
I'd rather work in Napa at the winery 
And then ya wonder why I'm stubborn 
Forever lookin' hard, I been scarred 

[Hook] 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Mirror, mirror make the call 
Who's the hardest of them all 

[Verse 3] 
Can't tell me shit, I come from a broken up home 
Every since I was a youth I thought that I was grown 
Meet me after school nigga and we can get it on 
Ya talked about my mammy now I'm goin' upside ya dome 
I got a complex problem, my guard stay up 
I'm always on the offense side, don't test my nuts 
I'm not a Charles nor a Larry but I'm scary 
Scared that I might lose it and chop you with my piece berry 
I deep into my shit and it's straight like that 
I be quick to clobber a motherfucker with my Flintstone bat 
Nobody likes me on my father's side of the family 
They can't stand me cause they think that I'm sellin' that candy 
I kid you not, all bullshit to the side 
I got 20,000 niggas in my organization 
Now which one of y'all niggas down to ride 
I gets juiced off the underground doja 
You know that Click shit, that independent shit 
It makes me feel like I want to 
Got me a baggy full of broccoli and a crooked eye 22 
I feel crafty, I mean that but I feel great 

[Hook] 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Right before I go to bed 
I make sure that my mirror's there 
I got a mirror in my pocket and I practice lookin' hard 
Mirror, mirror make the call 
Who's the hardest of them all
