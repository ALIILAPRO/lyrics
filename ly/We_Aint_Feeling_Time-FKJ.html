		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took me under sure
Never done growing up, no
My smile is rarely there, no
I call you my precious lock
Asking me where go from here
No, no we ain't feeling the damn time passing
No, we ain't feeling the damn time, no

You give me faith to care
Angels spreading love
You shine and you can't prevent it
Ball of light coming from above
Have no clue where we go from here
From here, from here, from here
No, no we ain't feeling the damn time passing
No, we ain't feeling the damn time, no

You took me under sure
Never done growing up
My smile is so rarely there now
I calling up precious like
Asking me where we go from here
No, no we ain't feeling the damn time passing
No we ain't feeling the damn time, no

You give me faith to care
Angels spreading love
You shine and you can't prevent it
Ball of light coming from above
Have no clue where we go from here
From here, from here, from here
No, no we ain't feeling the damn time passing
No, we ain't feeling the damn time
