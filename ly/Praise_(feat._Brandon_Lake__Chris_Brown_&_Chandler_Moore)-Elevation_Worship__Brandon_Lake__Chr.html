		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go, one, two, hey
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord (you got it), praise the Lord
Let everything, let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord

I'll praise in the valley, praise on the mountain (yeah)
I'll praise when I'm sure, praise when I'm doubting
I'll praise when outnumbered, praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the waters my enemies drown in

As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord, oh my soul (c'mon)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

I'll praise when I feel it, and I'll praise when I don't (yeah)
I'll praise 'cause I know You're still in control
'Cause my praise is a weapon, it's more than a sound (more than a sound)
Oh, my praise is the shout that brings Jericho down (yeah)

As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord (c'mon), oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside? (I gotta)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
(Yeah, praise the Lord)

C'mon let me see that dance, put a dance on it tonight (yeah)
If you're grateful, c'mon
Hey, hey, yeah

I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign, praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful, praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign, praise 'cause You reign (you reign)
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful, praise 'cause You're true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You

Praise the Lord, oh my soul
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul (praise the Lord, oh my soul)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside? (How could I)
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside? (I won't keep quiet)
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside? (I gotta)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Let everything that has breath (hey, hey)
Praise the Lord (hey, hey), praise the Lord
Let everything, let everything (c'mon, c'mon)
that has breath (c'mon, c'mon)
Praise the Lord (c'mon, c'mon)
Praise the Lord 
(Let everything), let everything (if you got breath in your body)
That has breath (if you got breath in your body)
Praise the Lord (praise the Lord, c'mon) 
praise the Lord
(Let everything), let everything that has breath (that has breath)
(Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord (praise), praise the Lord
