		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stuck again,
In the same old game,
And there's no way in,
No way out.

I found me a man,
That don't give a damn,
So I wait, I wait every night.

If I try to explain
What breaks me so,
He cries and begs for me not to go,

And so I stay and I hold his hand
As he looks away without a sound
And so I stay and I hold his hand
As he looks away without a sound

And I try to forget,
And believe what you say,
The excuses you make and the game that you play

But something's gone wrong,
Because once I was strong,
And now I'm down on my knees trying to please.. you

And so I stay and I hold your hand,
As he looks away, without a sound.
And so I stay and I hold his hand
As he looks away, without a sound.

And I find no peace,
And I find no rest,
As I stare at the hands that go around and around.

And I find no peace,
And I find no rest,
As I wait for my man whose hands go around.

And so I stay and I hold his hand,
As he looks away, without a sound
And so I stay and I hold his hand,
As he looks away, without a sound.
