		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in the wind without nothing to my name
I have it all
You can bow to me or watch the blade fall
To your neck
Another fraud murked and left in the dirt
Take your pride for what it's worth
Or sacrifice yourself for the hearse

Lost in the wind without nothing to my name
I have it all
You can bow to me or watch the blade fall
To your neck
Another fraud murked and left in the dirt
Take your pride for what it's worth
Or sacrifice yourself for the hearse

Break my trust i'mma break your jaw
Breaking the law with the fuckin' sawed off
They don't know what they saw
But they know I popped off
Tell your friends and family
That I started the stopwatch
And I'm coming with the vengeance
Brute force to your neck leave you neck less
I am reckless, commencin'
The final phase today
By tonight this fight will
Be over don't stay where ya eat
Where ya sleep
Leave or suffer with the sheep
No mercy to the opposition
Mercy for the weak
Mercy ain't no proposition
Imma hurt you with the speech
Than I'll murk you in the street
Dump your body in the deep cut up your pride
Cut out your eyes i'm sick of the lies
Nothing you can hide
So remove yourself and bow to the king
Or get your neck slit by your majesty

Lost in the wind without nothing to my name
I have it all
You can bow to me or watch the blade fall
To your neck
Another fraud murked and left in the dirt
Take your pride for what it's worth
Or sacrifice yourself for the hearse

Lost in the wind without nothing to my name
I have it all
You can bow to me or watch the blade fall
To your neck
Another fraud murked and left in the dirt
Take your pride for what it's worth
Or sacrifice yourself for the hearse
