		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moving, moving out
Said too many things to shout
Had enough of you
And the things in life you choose to do
Could've been beautiful
But everything is growing cold
This is now when I grow old

You know it makes me very angry
And I never get so angry

Taking back what was mine
At least I thought so at the time
Everything changes
And I don't know what was before
Something should be there
But I have known and I don't know
This is now when I grow old

You know it makes me very angry
And I never get so angry

This is the last time
I'll take this from you
This is the last time
I'll take this from you

You know it makes me very angry
And I never get so angry

You know it makes me very angry
And I never get so angry

You know you make me very angry…
