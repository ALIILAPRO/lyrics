		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you got power, superpowers
Do you even know how to wield them?
All God's children are special
But not like you, no, not like you
You're just like a flower (flower)
You're ever-giving, that's a given
All God's children are special (all God's children, whoa)
But not like you, no, not like you

(Lift it, lift it, lift it)
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh sky, sky)
(Lift it, lift it, lift it, lift it)

It's crazy to say this
But you are the greatest (you are the greatest)
Can't explain it (oh)
I know that you know, don't you?
They can't deny you, yeah
They can't deny you, it's true
Yeah, remember Vegas? You come a long way, kid
And let me just say this
Oh yeah, you're the main character now
You're the main character now

(Lift it, lift it, lift it)
Lift your head to the sky (to the sky, oh sky, sky)

(You're the main character now)
(You're the main character now)
Oh, yeah
