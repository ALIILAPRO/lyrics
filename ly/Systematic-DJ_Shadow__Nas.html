		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The system will defeat itself
Nothing stays in a steady state, it overheats and melts
It only feeds itself, the system
Yo, I think it exists just because, like a pit eats its pups
Eats its own litter up
The system's fucked, it's corrupt
It's poison, survival is genocidal
No place or origin, no beginning cycle
Let's occupy all streets
It's crazy to think in the '80s
I wanted minks, and a Benz to listen to Michael
And Grand Puba Maxwell and get cash
While I'm sippin' on drinks
In Nike sweatsuits and Gucci links
I'm like a Russian mob figure, I'm mad low
In the shadows, big up to Shadow
DJ Shadow arose to throw blows
Can't see me but Nas moving the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses

Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm saying
To make you feel is my new expression
Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm saying
To make you feel is my new expression

Systematic
Systematic

I wish I was an arms dealer to sell illegal arms in the hood
No backup check, put cash in my palms and we good
Lack of respect get you to fall where you stood
Mathematics is God's language, it's in my blood
Art, music, letters and numbers
I'm a vessel, I'm humble
Meeting start ups, I invest if I want to
Transforming global markets with all of my partners
Methodical corporate culture, straight out the projects
What's the ingredients to the realest?
Place two cups of cranberry in the skillet
A half a cup of water, add some Henny
Let it cook for eight minutes, but you ain't finished
Let it simmer 'til the cranberry pop a little
Keep stirring, sip it, it's art like Keith Haring
It gets in your blood, you start to feel what I'm feeling
Don't listen, just try to feel what I'm feeling

Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm saying
To make you feel is my new expression
Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm saying
To make you feel is my new expression

Systematic, uh
Systematic

Remember the past
Cherish the present and work for tomorrow
The time is now
Time is now
