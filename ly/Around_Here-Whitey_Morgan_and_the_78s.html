		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The life of the party
the life of this house
What little light that i had left inside this heart of mine just went out
No I love you
there was no goodbye
She just grabbed the keys in silence
turned engine that was it
she was flying yeah she was flying

Now she's somewhere out there high on champagne glasses
carrying on like she didn't do me wrong
I'm down here on the floor walls collapsing
I can't even drink her memory gone
Ain't it hard to move on
when you're down to the last of last night's beer
it's the bottom of the bottle around here

I'm going to get up
but girl it's gonna take time
I keep reaching up and reaching out
and loving her and hating her in my mind
hell I can't deicide

Now she's somewhere out there high on champagne glasses
carrying on like she didn't do me wrong
I'm down here on the floor walls collapsing
I can't even drink her memory gone
AIn't it hard to move on
when you're down to the last of last night's beer
it's the bottom of the bottle around here

she's somewhere out there high on champagne glasses
Dancing while the band plays all night long
I'm mad and drunk and still ain't sure what happened
Why did she go and do a good man gone
ain't it hard to move on when your down 
to the last of the last of last night's beer
It's the bottom of the bottle around here

she's somewhere out there high on champagne glasses
Dancing while the band plays cheating songs
I'm down here on the floor walls collapsing
