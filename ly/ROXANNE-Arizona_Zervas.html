All she wanna do is party all night, ayy

Met her at a party in the Hills, yeah
She just wanna do it for the thrill, yeah
Shorty drive a poodle with no top (top, top)
But if I throw this money she gon' drop, ayy
She don't wait in lines if it's too long
She don't drive the whip unless the roof off
Only want to call when the cash out
Only take the pic when her ass out

She from Malibu, uh, Malibu
If you ain't got a foreign then she laugh at you, uh
Malibu, uh, Malibu
Spending daddy's money with a attitude

On the coast, ooh
Shorty only like cocaine and Whole Foods
Yeah, snappin' all up on the 'Gram, ass going crazy
Now she wanna fuck me in the foreign goin' eighty

Up in Malibu, uh, Malibu
If you ain't got a foreign then she laugh at you, uh
Malibu, uh, Malibu
Spending daddy's money with a attitude
