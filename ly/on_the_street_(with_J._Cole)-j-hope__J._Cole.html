		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I walk
Every time I run
Every time I move
As always, for us

Every time I look
Every time I love
Every time I hope
As always, for us (on the street, I'm still)

내 두 발은 선뜻 걸어 anywhere
J in the air
가는 길이 희망이 되고자 하여 나 구태여
Even my walk was made of
Your love and your faith
보답을 해, 저 멀리서라도 나비가 되어

Now just walk lightly, whenever you want
Go on hopefully, wherever you walk
누군가의 숨이 깃들어 있는 거리
내 영혼과 영원을 담을게
Everywhere (I'll be)

Every time I walk
Every time I run
Every time I move
As always, for us

Every time I look
Every time I love
Every time I hope
As always, for us (on the street, I'm still)

Yeah
All hail the mighty survivor of hell
Plopped down from Heaven to sell
Holy water that I scooped from the well
Fought tooth and a nail
Just to prevail amongst the ruthless
As I move through the field, feelin' worried
In a hurry, like a two-minute drill
To make a couple mil' off a lucrative deal
Selling train of thought
Name a artist who could derail
You'll never see it like a nigga 
Hula hoopin' in jail

I got a friend smart as fuck
But he stupid as hell
He swear that God ain't real
Since it ain't no way to prove it his self
As if the universe ain't enough
As if the volcanoes ain't erupt
As if the birds don't chirp
As if a trillion nerves don't work in the human body
Shit, who would I be?
Without the creator of this theater
Beside me to gently guide me?
Somedays I wonder if I need to pick a different hobby

I'm deep in with this rappin'
It's all a nigga know
I never didn't nothin' better
It's hard to let it go
But like a father watching his daughter
Walk down the altar with tears in his eyes
You gotta let her grow
And so I shall
But first I been honing my style
Coldest around
With more quotables than what the quota allows
You see a top ten list, I see a Golden Corral, nigga

As the moon jumps over the cow
I contemplate if I should wait to hand over the crown
And stick around for a bit longer
I got a strange type of hunger
The more I eat, the more it gets stronger
The more it gets stronger
I said the more it gets stronger
j-hope
Cole World

Every time I walk (every time I walk, every time I)
Every time I run (every time I run, I run to you)
Every time I move (every time I move, I move for you)
As always, for us (do this for us now)

Every time I look (every time I)
Every time I love (every time I)
Every time I hope (hope, for us)
As always, for us (on the street, I'm still)

Every time I walk
Every time I run
Every time I move
As always, for us

Every time I look
Every time I love
Every time I hope
As always, for us (on the street, I'm still)
