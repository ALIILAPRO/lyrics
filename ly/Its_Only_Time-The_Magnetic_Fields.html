		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why would I stop loving you
A hundred years from now?
It's only time.
It's only time.

What could stop this beating heart
Once it's made a vow?
It's only time.
It's only time.

If rain won't change your mind,
Let it fall.
The rain won't change my heart
At all.

Lock this chain
Around my hand,
Throw away the key.
It's only time.
It's only time.

Years falling
Like grains of sand
Mean nothing to me.
It's only time.
It's only time.

If snow won't change your mind
Let it fall.
The snow won't change my heart,
Not at all.

(I'll walk your lands)
I'll walk your lands
(And swim your sea)
And swim your sea

Marry me.
Marry me.

(Then in your hands)
Then in your hands
(I will be free)
I will be free

Marry me.
Marry me.

Why would I stop loving you
A hundred years from now?
