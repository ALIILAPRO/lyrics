		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make no sound
As folks gather 'round
Like shadow hounds
Eyes seem unsound
As folks gather 'round
And please you aloud

And I now believe that no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength

And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
The pain and strengths so vast

From mellow seas
To houses on wheels
To slabs in West land
Hand in hand
From yellow bills
To slabs in West land
Like bones in your hands

But I see a tree that's standing high among the shrubs
So only one hand may rest its palm upon my cheeks
The only one that I'll need

To know why no one asked
About your secret past
The pain to match your strength

And I now believe that no one thought
You had a lonely past
And pain to match your vein
When it rains
