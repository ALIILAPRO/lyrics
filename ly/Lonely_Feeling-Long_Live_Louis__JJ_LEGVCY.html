		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feelin' Lonely, you ain't waiting on me
Said you won't leave, how you changing on me?
Said you won't leave, that ain't right
Babygirl I tried- Why'd you push me to the side? (to the side?)
Feelin' Lonely, you ain't waiting on me
Said you won't leave, how you changing on me?
Said you won't leave, that ain't right
Babygirl I tried- Why'd you push me to the side? (to the side yeah.)

You can push me to the side like I'm still in your way
Bet you're wishing you were mine, coming to the tour dates
Now I wanna be alone because I'm sick of your ways
We been making so much money gotta split it four ways
There was a time, not too long ago, when I was  kid, not doing these shows
No I didn't write, no reason for prose, she hit me with cons, you know how it goes
No reason for rhyme, no designer clothes, when I was a kid, I followed the code
No I didn't fight, I didn't have foes, we all got along, my standards were low
But times are way different now
I'm finding my way, not using the code
I wanted a break, but I never fold, your friends are all fake, you know how it goes
There's nothing to take, there's nothing to own, I'm staying awake, the night is too cold
A man with his cape, can sit on his throne, but he can't escape, that he's still alone

Feelin' Lonely, you ain't waiting on me
Said you won't leave, how you changing on me?
Said you won't leave, that ain't right
Babygirl I tried- Why'd you push me to the side? (to the side?)
Feelin' Lonely, you ain't waiting on me
Said you won't leave, how you changing on me?
Said you won't leave, that ain't right
Babygirl I tried- Why'd you push me to the side? (to the side yeah.)

Pushin' me off to the side
You know you're enticing
You know I'm not like them
I'm sick of this fightin'
So now you want ice again? ('gain)
Now you want flights again? ('gain)
How you gon' leave me lonely?
I ain't paying no price again
Nah, got me doing these things that I shouldn't do
Nowadays I can't even look at you
Now when I'm swerving I feel like I'm bulletproof
Still tryna look for the good in you
No girl I can't find it
Thought you were my everything
Now everything is silent
So look where I'm at
I'm in love with a girl who could not give a fuck bout' loving me
Only come back when the champagne bubbly
Other than that, she was still straight dubbing me
Girl why you duckin' me?
Man, straight from the start, I wanted the real
Frozen my heart and I'm dodging the pills
I don't even know how to feel

Feelin' Lonely, you ain't waiting on me
Said you won't leave, how you changing on me?
Said you won't leave, that ain't right
Babygirl I tried- Why'd you push me to the side? (to the side?)
Feelin' Lonely, you ain't waiting on me
Said you won't leave, how you changing on me?
Said you won't leave, that ain't right
Babygirl I tried- Why'd you push me to the side? (to the side yeah.)
