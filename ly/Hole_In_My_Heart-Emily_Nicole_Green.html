		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It put a hole in my heart
Watching you walk away
It put a hole in my heart
Stopping myself from
Begging you to stay
Hole in my heart
It put a hole in my heart
It put a hole in my, hole in my
Hole in my heart
You let me in real close
Before you turned away
It took you way too, way too long
To say her name
I gave you
Every chance
To make it clear as day
Too hard to decide
You wanted it both ways
Now there's a hole in my heart
Screaming your name
There's a hole in my heart
And I'll never be the same
You loved feeding the fire
You liked the heat from the flames
But now there's a hole in my heart with your name
Your name, your name, your name
There's a hole in my heart with your name
I was the one who knocked
But you let me in
We wouldn't say the words
But oh, we were feeling them
You knew the hand you were playin'
But wouldn't show me your cards
And now I'm drowning in desire
'Cause there's a hole in my heart
Now there's a hole in my heart
Screaming your name
There's a hole in my heart
And I'll never be the same
You loved feeding the fire
You liked the heat from the flames
But now there's a hole in my heart with your name
There's a hole in my heart with your name
We were holding hands sitting on concrete steps
When it started to rain
They were rough, we were wet
But you stayed
We drank dark spirits in the back of dark rooms
Beating chest, smiling face
You kept one eye on the door
But you stayed
I kissed you in the taxi on the bridge that night
Hands hot, lips stained
You told me it was over
But you stayed
Craving you hijacked my body
It made my mind go insane
I wasn't able to stop it
I couldn't make me behave
We always paid out of pocket
You always stayed out too late
And if we made it to daylight
Coffee on St. Mark's Place
But now there's a hole in my heart
Screaming your name
There's a hole in my heart
And I'll never be the same
You loved feeding the fire
You liked the heat from the flames
But now there's a hole in my heart with your name
There's a hole in my heart with your name
