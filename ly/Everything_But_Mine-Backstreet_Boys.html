		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking along the sky
Chasing a glimpse of you
Painting a world with stars I found inside your eyes
Up here above the haze
Everything looks so clear
Wondering what it would be like if you were here

And time takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
But I can't wait
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

I hold you close when it all goes crazy
And through it all, you'll be my lady
Why, tell me why
You're everything
Everything but mine

You don't have to be afraid
Of somebody else's touch
Just gimme a chance to prove
Just how you should be loved

And time, it takes time ([Howie:] takes time)
It's not too late
To tell you how I feel

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

Everything but mine
Mine I know, oh baby
Someday you'll come around
I'm gonna leave the light on
And I won't let you down
No I won't let you down

I won't let you down

Oh, you're the calm when my world is crashing
My heart, my blood, my passion
Why, tell me why
You're everything but mine

You're everything but mine
You're everything but mine
You're the sun, you're the star
You're the moon, you're the rain
Love your lips, love your eyes
Drivin' me insane, oh baby, baby
Everything but mine
You're everything but mine
