		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the first part of the journey
I was lookin' at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
And the sky with no clouds
The heat was hot and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound

I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

After two days in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

Ah, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
Ah, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la

After nine days, I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with its life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love

You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain

La, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la, la
