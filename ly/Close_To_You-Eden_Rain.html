		  CLOSE TO YOU

Did you know
before I see you
I'm the loneliest girl in the city

Did you know
Before I work my way back to you
I do dumb stuff just to stay busy

And then it's coffee, relax, loose change, train tracks
It all goes right for me.
Taxi, green lights, blue gate, turn right
This journey three times a week.

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Hands up on the headrest
Jealous of your necklace
I just wanna be that close to you
Skin on skin is nothing
Not enough just touching
I just wanna be that close to you

And the ghosts that haunt me want you
They're not used to the love that you prove
I was in such a rush to grow up
Spent months missing out on your touch

Lay me down
Lay me down
Lay me down

Hands up on the headrest
Jealous of your necklace
I just wanna be that close to you
Skin on skin is nothing
Not enough just touching
I just wanna be that close to you

Hands up on the headrest
Jealous of your necklace
I just wanna be that close to you
