		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get by one eye in the sky
But I can't put my finger on it
I want to cry, I'm out of my mind
Trying to figure it out

Moderation
I can't have it
I don't want it
I wanna touch it

Picture the party where you're standing on a modern age
I was in trouble with a habit of years
And I try to relate

I get by pushing poets aside
'Cause they can't beat the mother of pearl
I quit the Earth, I'm out of my mind
And the fruit of it all

Moderation
I can't have it
I don't want it
I wanna touch it

Picture the party where you're standing on a modern age
I was in trouble with a habit of years
And I try to relate
To the mess I made

Tethered to a mess
Tethered to a mess
Tethered to a mess
Tethered to a mess

Picture the party where you're standing on a modern age
I was in trouble with the habit of years
And I try to relate
