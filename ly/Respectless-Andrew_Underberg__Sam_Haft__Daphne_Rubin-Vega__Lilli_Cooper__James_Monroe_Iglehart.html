		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better show some respect!
Check your behavior, no one speaks to Zestial that way!
Did you expect us to sit back
And take your insolent, brazen display?

You've got it twisted
I'm not the one who needs a new attitude
Maybe you missed it, but I'm that #Bitch
And I will do nothing less than what I please, woo!
I'm the backbone of the Vees
Mad that I acted respectless?
Well, it's 'cause no one could respect this

Sorry group attendin'
Since when are overlords too scared to fight?
You're long past trendin'
Sorry, bae, but I ain't swipin' right
You lost your relevance

We can't act without more intelligence

Ugh, no wonder I'm so respectless
I could eat you lot for breakfast

You and the Vees are inane and uninformed
Smug wannabes, who don't heed when you've been warned

Oops! Did I strike a nerve?
'Cause when I brought out the angel's head
Couldn't help but observe
That your wrinkled face was turning red
And why are you avoidin' war?
That's what the guns you sell are for
Thanks to my being respectless
One thing I'm starting to suspect is
You know why this angel's headless
Do you have a disclosure?

This meeting's over!
