		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you've blessed me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinkin' my journey's come to an end, oh
Sending out a farewell to my friends
For inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins
Oh, would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent
My spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong
Because someone else is telling me that it's wrong
But I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again
We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can't be hard on yourself for, these were the cards that you were given
So you have to understand that these like
That's not who you are
You know you're trying to be the best you can be
But that's all you can do
If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself
Give it all you got
But if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That's what it's, what's happening with me
It's like, God I'm givin' it all I got
Sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it
And it's like I'm not givin' myself grace
I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is
