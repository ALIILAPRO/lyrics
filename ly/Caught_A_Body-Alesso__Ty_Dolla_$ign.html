		  Damn, that thing so good, she put a spell on me
Just caught a body, this might be the end of me
Just caught a body
Just caught a body

Just caught a body

I'ma take a bad bitch out the crowd to my dressing room, ooh-ooh
If she can't fuck that day, baby, ooh-ooh
I'ma lay her down (yeah)
And tell her, "Open your mouth," ayy
If the homies can't come in, I don't wanna go
If it ain't about the money, I don't wanna know
She know I ain't from 'round here
Hit her when I'm back in town

Damn, that thing so good, she put a spell on me
Just caught a body, this might be the end of me
Just caught a body
Just caught a body

Just caught a body
Just caught a body

Damn, that thing so good, she put a spell on me
Just caught a body, this might be the end of me
Just caught a body
Just caught a body
