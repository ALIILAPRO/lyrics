		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you get older, plainer, saner
Will you remember all the danger we came from?
Burning like embers, falling, tender
Longing for the days of no surrender years ago
And will you know

So smoke 'em if you got 'em 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
I'll never get to heaven 'cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you, oh
Tell me are they lost on you, oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you
Oh-oh, oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wishin' I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me, all the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em 'cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven this can turn around
Let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you, oh
Tell me are they lost on you, oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you
Oh-oh, oh
Is that lost on you?
Oh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

(Lost on you)
(Lost on you)

Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you, oh
Tell me are they lost on you, oh
Just that you could cut me loose, oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
