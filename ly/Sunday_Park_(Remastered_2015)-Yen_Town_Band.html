		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In The Sunday Park
Light in the aftenoon
I listen to the sound
of my dream Coming through
All the mountains or
Blueberries and greens
fairy tale lullaby
I was down last night
Too much to handle here
I didn't know how to carry on
Still lucky
All the mess in my head,
is fading now
Among the crowd on the street
I wish you'd come to my place
You would be smiling
so close to me
I wish the day dream never ends

I'm the kind of girl,
who lives only for today
but I think it's o.k
to be myself
Especially
when you're not around
I need someone to hold
I know how to have fun

I wish you were here by my side
we would be talking
something silly
I wish the day dream never ends

When I feel a single beat
of my lonely heart
I can sing,I can cry,
without knowing why
Yes I tried and I tried
to the way to you
somehow life always leads
through a maze
everyday eveiynight
you live in my mind
everyday everynight
still pleasure and pain
melodies of memories
will never stop
you are with me
until the end of time
just a day dream
in The Sunday Park
