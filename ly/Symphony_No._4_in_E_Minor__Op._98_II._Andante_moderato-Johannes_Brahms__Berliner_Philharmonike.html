		  Hey, girl, this yo song, let's see that badonkadonk
I'mma try to do the things that you don't
Baby, it's yo party, I just wanna play
What's that sound? What's that thang that's got me like wow?
I'm tryna beat beat it up twelve rounds
Girl, look at that body, I just gotta say

When you back back back back back it up
And you drop it down low
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up
Girl, I'm ready to blow
I'mma stack stack stack stack stack it up
And I'm spending it all
When I throw throw throw throw throw it up

Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley

You got everybody in this club lookin' at you girl
How you move that thing from side to side
Fuck everybody in this club, 'cause I got you girl
I'mma tell you what's goin' down tonight
Girl, it's gon' rain, that's that sound
That's that shit that's got you like wow
And would you let me beat beat twelve rounds
Baby, look at that body, I just gotta say

When you back back back back back it up
And you drop it down low
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up
Girl, I'm ready to blow
I'mma stack stack stack stack stack it up
And I'm spending it all
When I throw throw throw throw throw it up

Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley

I know you wore them jeans
So I can see that thong thong thong thong thong
Thong thong thong thong thong
Pop it like Miley
And don't forget that tongue tongue tongue tongue tongue
Tongue tongue tongue tongue tongue
Twenty more shots then I pass out
But that's what I'm aiming for
Baby, let me drown
When I wake up, I'm still in the club
Looking at the DJ, like turn my shit up, oh
So when the beat beat beat beat beat drops
Get your ass on the floor

Start twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
Twerkin' like Miley
Start twerkin' like Miley
