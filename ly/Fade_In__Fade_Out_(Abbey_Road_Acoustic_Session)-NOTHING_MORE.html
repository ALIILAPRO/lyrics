		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just the other day I looked at my father
It was the first time I saw he'd grown old
Canyons through his skin and the rivers that made them
Carved the stories I was told

He said
"Son, I have watched you fade in
You will watch me fade out
I have watched you fade in
You will watch me fade out
When the grip leaves my hand
I know you won't let me down

Go and find your way
Leave me in your wake
Always push through the pain
And don't run away from change
Never settle
Make your mark
Hold your head up
Follow your heart
Follow your heart"

Just the other day I stared at the ocean
With every new wave another must go
One day you'll remember us laughing
One day you'll remember my passion
One day you'll have one of your own

I say
"Son, I have watched you fade in
You will watch me fade out
When the grip leaves my hand
I know you won't let me down

Go and find your way
Leave me in your wake
Always push through the pain
And don't run away from change
Never settle
Make your mark
Hold your head up
Follow your heart
Follow your heart, follow your heart, follow your heart"

We all get lost sometimes trying to find what we're looking for
We all get lost sometimes trying to find what we're looking for

I have watched you fade in
You will watch me fade out
I have watched you fade in
You will watch me fade out
When the grip leaves my hand
I know you won't let me down

Go and find your way
Leave me in your wake
Always push through the pain
And don't run away from change

Never settle
Make your mark
Hold your head up
Follow your heart
Follow your heart
Follow your heart

When the morning comes and takes me
I promise I have taught you everything that you need
In the night you'll dream of so many things
But find the ones that bring you life, and you'll find me

That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me
That's where you'll find me"
