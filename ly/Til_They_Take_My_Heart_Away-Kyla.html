		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look into your eyes
so far away..
there's trouble on your mind
your losing faith

hey now...let me hold you
it'll be okay
'cause i will love you til' they take my heart away

Remember when you called
and said goodbye
you'd thought we'd lost it all
and so did i
even if i'd lost you
i wouLd feeL the same

cause i will love you til' they take my heart away
believe.. im here to stay
cause i will love you til' they take my heart away..

hoo..ooo.oo
now we're stronger than before
we've made it through
now i've never felt more sure
because of you

hey now are you listenin'
can u hear me say?
'cause i will love you til' they take my heart away
believe im here to stay...
'cause i will love you til' they take my heart away

believe...in me
i'm here to stay
'cause i will love you
til' they take my heart away..
away...away...
i will love you
til' they take my heart away
