		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl what you talkin' 'bout
I need you to settle down
It's hard enough as it is
No we're both sick of this
Feelings irrelevant and
At this point it is what it is

We're falling apart and torn at the seams
Oh don't you see that we are
Not what we used to be

So say what you need to say let me down
Oh my world shakes with these words you say
I sink deeper in the ground
My heart wants you to stay
But it's too late for all that now
Oh there's no such thing as a clean break
When your heart starts bleeding out

I tried to help you see
But attempts were lost on me
'Cause you never figured it out
You need the Holy Ghost
Or someone to let you know that
You're only weighing yourself down

We're falling apart and torn at the seams
Oh don't you see that we are
Not what we used to be

So say what you need to say let me down
Oh my world shakes with these words you say
I sink deeper in the ground
My heart wants you to stay
But it's too late for all that now
Oh there's no such thing as a clean break
When your heart starts bleeding out
