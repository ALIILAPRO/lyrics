		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Brrt, stick 'em, ha ha ha, stick 'em)
Turn me up, though, nigga
You gonna feel me, nigga
Niggas gon' respect this shit, though
On 2, on 2-1, nigga on 2, on 2-1, nigga
Nigga come around me, on 2-1
We got the block hot
You ain't never pop your, pop it, on my mama
You is not God

If you 2-1, you better get on the 5
Fuck it and get on the Fly
Ooh-wee, catch fifty shots if
They mess with mine
Call it a headshot, but he still alive
Bitch, I ain't got the time
To argue with you 'bout your cousin, ho
Beat that nigga up
I can tell you one thing, lil' mama
I beat that pussy up
Have that pussy loose off these tricks
I wasn't tryna fuck run it in, Wisconsin
I know you 'bout your bucks
Ayy, ayy, bitch, I need everything
'Cause my niggas fightin' cases
They ain't said a thing
Either way, you in the box, nigga
Ain't nothin' changеd
Lil' nigga, you tryna box
You ain't got a thing?

Shooting guard like I'm Sprewell
Thеse ain't bullets, cuddie
These are K shells
Ayy, ayy, on the block with it
I don't need help
Ooh-wee, bitch, you know I'm to the neck
Nigga
We lash niggas, soul-strip him tryna flex
Nigga man down, last dude was the next nigga
(We know the truth)
Ooh-wee, should've wore a helmet
Fuck a vest, nigga
(Long live Jameon Davis)
Ayy, I'm so Southeast

Pump-faked him with the K
He thought he had a mouthpiece
Blam blam, man down
Some shit I went to trial for
My opps be on Twitter 'cause
They scared to come outside
Street sweep, meet meet
This Draco make the crowd run
The outcome, buddy chalk somethin'
They need pallbearers
Thirty-four shots, Paul Pierce
Pick your jaw up
No trace, Arkansas plates, made his car run
Forty ounce bounce
Make it shake like a porno
Bitch, don't ever try to throw the
Flag when we in war mode
Pizza party, bitch, this ain't delivery
This DiGiorno
Burnt a nigga, all these Ernie niggas
We need Elmo the candid camera, watch your
Friends and family, man
Who really love you?
Who you really trustin'? Them
Pills got you buggin'
Head and shoulders, talkin' guns and roses
Foreigns with parolees
Tonka trucks and police, you better notice
But long mouths get you elbows
How you knew? Told you (The Ruler)

(Brrt)
