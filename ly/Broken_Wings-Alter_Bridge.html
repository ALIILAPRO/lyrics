		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fight the fight alone
When the world is full of victims
Dims a fading light
In our souls

Leave the peace alone
Now we all are slowly changing
Dims a fading light 
In our souls

In my opinion seeing is to know
The things we hold
Are always first to go
And who's to say
We won't end up alone

On broken wings I'm falling 
And it won't be long
The skin on me is burning 
By the fires of the sun
On skinned knees
I'm bleeding
And it won't be long
I've got to find that meaning 
I'll search for so long

Cry ourselves to sleep
We will sleep alone forever
Will you lay me down
In the same place with all I love

Mend the broken homes
Care for them they are our brothers
Save the fading light in our souls

In my opinion seeing is to know
What you give
Will always carry you
And who's to say 
We won't survive it too

On broken wings I'm falling 
And it won't be long
The skin on me is burning 
By the fires of the sun
On skinned knees
I'm bleeding
And it won't be long
I've got to find that meaning 
I'll search for so long


Set a-free all 
Relying on their will 
To make me all that I am 
And all that I'll be

Set a-free all
Will fall between the cracks
With memories of all that I am
And I'll that I'll be

On broken wings I'm falling 
And it won't be long
The skin on me is burning 
By the fires of the sun
On skinned knees
I'm bleeding
And it won't be long
I've got to find that meaning 
I'll search for so long
