		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you

I've got my boarding ticket
I've got that load
Conductor done hollered, "All aboard"
Take my seat, right way back
Watch this train moving down the track

Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you

I think about the good times we once had
Soul got happy, now my heart got glad
I think about the way you love me too
You can bet your life I'm coming home to you
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
Bring it on home to you
Bring it on home to you
Bring it on home to you bring it on home
Bring it on home to you

Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
Got to bring it on home to you
Got to bring it on home to you
Bring it on home to you bring it on home
Bring it on home bring it on home to you
Bring it on home bring it on home
I got to bring it on home
