		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried my way but I keep falling apart

All that I see, is the wickedness around me
I refuse to believe, the apocalypse inside of me
I can't even trust myself
I'm burning in my skin
Standing at the gates of Hell, but nobody will let me in

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried my way but I keep falling apart
I'll follow you, with all of my heart
I'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep falling and falling apart

I'll stand here again, forsaken in a place 
That feels like I can never win
I'm reaching for a saving grace
I can't even trust no one
I need to rise above 
I don't think I'm good enough, to feel your perfect love

I'll follow you out of the dark
I tried my way but I keep falling apart
I'll follow you, with all of my heart
I'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep falling and falling apart
I'm falling and falling apart
I'm falling apart

Your love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it
I'm in the ashes of mercy, I'm covered in it
I fall hard and you carry me away
I fall part so you can set me free
Your love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it
I'm in the ashes of mercy, I'm covered in it
I fall hard and you carry me
I fall apart so you can set me free
I follow you out of the dark
I tried my way but I keep falling apart
I'll follow you with all of my heart
I'm tired of my ways, 'cause I keep falling and falling apart
I'm falling and falling apart
Without you I'm falling apart
I'm falling and falling apart
