		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight fog
Illuminated by the light of a full moon
You know that some thing is coming for you
But you didn't think it would be so soon

Come inside and enjoy a brand new terrified state of mind
Leave everything else behind 
And be consumed by the spirit of the night

Beyond the cemetery, lies a very lively crowd
Welcome to Halloweentown
The party lies 6 feet underground
Within a deathly silence, know you'll never be alone
Just let the moons eclipse embrace your lips and take you home

Can you feel it?
That fear running through your mind
Your heartbeat gets faster and faster 
As midnight grows closer with no fucking end in sight

The air so deathly still you feel like you can hardly breathe
Just let the pumpkin king take control 
And make you a slave of all hallows eve

Beyond the cemetery, lies a very lively crowd
Welcome to Halloween town
The party lies 6 feet underground
Within a deathly silence, know you'll never be alone
Just let the moons eclipse embrace your lips and take you home

You'll never be alone as long as you're dead
Tell me, in your veins, does the blood run red?
Go ahead
Try to make an escape away from me

No one's going to hear you scream
Happy hallo-fucking-ween

Beyond the cemetery, lies a very lively crowd
Welcome to Halloween town
The party lies 6 feet underground
Within a deathly silence, know you'll never be alone
Just let the moons eclipse embrace your lips and take you home

Beyond the cemetery
Welcome to Halloweentown
