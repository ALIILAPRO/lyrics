		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, now you're walking on broken glass
Atoning for your fucked up past
I already knew that we wouldn't last
You're no good at covering your tracks
Bitch, now you're walking on broken glass
Atoning for your fucked up past
I already knew that we wouldn't last
You're no good at covering your tracks
We booked a flight, but it crashed and burned
We both lived but you didn't learn
Turbulence made my stomach turn
It wasn't hard for me to discern
I can see into the transmundane
Everybody thought I was insane
They threw their shade because I played those games
They didn't know you did the same
You didn't know until I showed my face
I cast a line and you took the bait
For me it was a piece of cake
You figured out, but it was too late
You really should've seen your face
A deer in the headlights
Bitch, now you're walking on broken glass
Atoning for your fucked up past
I already knew that we wouldn't last
You're no good at covering your tracks
Bitch, now you're walking on broken glass
Atoning for your fucked up past
I already knew that we wouldn't last
You're no good at covering your tracks
