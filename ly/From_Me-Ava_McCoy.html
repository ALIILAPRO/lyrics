		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I could die
Even when I wasn't out to dry
I felt my hands on the back of my neck
Saying what you want from me?
cnd I can't seem to find my way
No, I can't seem to escape

Oh, what you want from me?
I can't breathe
I can't breathe 

I can't see the back of my eyes
When I face you lookin' my way tonight
Tonight
cnd if I could only be myself for an hour or three
Not who you thought I should be

I can't imagine
cll that we had
cnd I can't imagine
cll that was said

I'm so glad
I'm so glad
Oh, I'm so glad
I'm so glad
