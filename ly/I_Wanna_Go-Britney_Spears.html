		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been stuck imagining
What I wanna do and what I really think
Time to blow out
Be a little inappropriate
'Cause I know that everybody's thinking it
When the lights out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind
Whoa, oh, oh

I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind, woah-oh

Lately people got me all tied up
There's a countdown waiting for me to erupt
Time to blow out
I've been told who I should do it with
To keep both my hands above the blanket
When the lights out

Shame on me
To need release
Uncontrollably

I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind

I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind
Whoa oh oh

Shame on me (shame on me)
To need release (to need release)
Uncontrollably (uncontrollably-lably-lably-lably)

I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind

I, I, I wanna go-o-o all the way-ay-ay
Taking out my freak tonight
I, I, I wanna show-ow-ow
All the dir-irt-irt
I got running through my mind
Whoa oh oh
