		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been reading too much
Too much into things
That I forgot the art
Of watching the world pass by
I've altered my mind
Elasticity, I used to think
It was the bane of my existence
But now I see
It as a tool
To alter my heart
To alter my life

There's a way
To break
This spell
Just wait
And watch
Yourself
The whole world
Is catching up
But you
Seem to want
It to stop
And go
Back

Timeless entities
Broken in my dreams
They come back together
When I wake
But seamlessly
They evade my every glance
Listen closely won't you
You won't do anything
That puts your mind
At risk, I understand
You have to keep a close watch
To not alter your mind
Lest you alter your life

There's a way
To break
This spell
Just wait
And watch
Yourself
The whole world
Is catching up
But you
Seem to want
It to stop
And go
Back

The day's only longer
The day's only longer
To me
To me
The day's only longer
The day's only longer
To me
To me

There's a way
To break
This spell
Just wait
And watch
Yourself
The world
Is catching up
But you
Seem to want
It to stop
And go
Back
