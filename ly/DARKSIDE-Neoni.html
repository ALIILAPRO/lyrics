		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My, my, my, my, my my, my
My, my, my

Do you want to meet all my monsters?
Think you're tough? I know they'll drive you bonkers
Meet 'em once and they'll forever haunt ya, yeah, yeah
There's no heroes or villains in this place
Just shadows that dance in my headspace
Leaving nothing but phantoms in their wake (in their wake)
There's parts of me I cannot hide (ooh)
I've tried and tried a million times (ooh)

La-da-da-de-dah, la-da-da-de-dah, la-da-da-de-dah
Cross my heart and hope to die
Welcome to my dark side
Ooh to da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh to da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)

Take a step into the havoc
Look around, this ain't even the half of it
I'm walking the line between panic and losing my mind
Embracing the madness
My devils they whisper in my ear
Deafening me with all my fears
I'm living in a nightmare
There's parts of me I cannot hide
I've tried and tried a million times (million times)

La-da-da-de-dah, la-da-da-de-dah, la-da-da-de-dah
Cross my heart and hope to die
Welcome to my dark side
Ooh to da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh to da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (yeah yeah yeah)

Ooh, dark side, ooh (ooh)
Cross my heart and hope to die
Welcome to my dark side
Ooh to my da-da-dark side
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (to my dark side)
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (to my dark side)
Ooh to my da-da-dark side (welcome to my dark side)
