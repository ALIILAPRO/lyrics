		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancin' with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

And I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake up call
I'm facin' the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signin' off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends, we miss rock and roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When, baby, I was doin' nothin' the most of all

The culture is lit and if this is it, I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake up call
I'm facin' the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

If this is it, I'm signin' off
Miss doin' nothin', the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames, it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost on
