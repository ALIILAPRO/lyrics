		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make out, make out, you must run,
Divide and rule, more and more
Say the word, hardcore, hardcore

You live your life, behind your eyes,
You got no life, no disguise,

Be my baby, I ain't gonna cry
Shut your mouth, wanna do the dog,
Sex with needles, gonna get you off
Outlaw, outlaw, no ma'am, no way
Damn shame, I'll say, I'll say
Going to a freak show, to take my pain away.

Breakout, breakout, you must dance,
Divide and fall, more and more,
Save the world, high score, high score,

You live your life, behind the wall,
You got no life, not at all.

Be my baby, I ain't gonna cry
Shut you down, wanna do the dog,
Sex with monsters, gonna get you off
Outlaw, outlaw, no ma'am, no way
Turn me down, damn shame, I'll say
Going to a gun show, to take my brain away.

Fake out, fake out, you can't leave,
Divide and stall, more and more,
Say the word, webcore, webcore,

You crawl with life, behind your face,
You got no life, no disgrace,

Be my baby, I ain't gonna die
Stay right there, wanna do the dog,
Sex with killers, ain't gonna get them off
Outlaw, outlaw, no man, no way
Turn me down, damn shame, I'll say
Going to a gun show, to take my shame away.
