		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the symbiote
Master of flesh 
Bender of blood 
Thy harvest awaits 

One by one the vessels scream
Their body begins rejecting me
Suffocate with bleeding eyes
Parasitic power unsustained 
I revive myself 
Through carrion remains 
Genital eviseration 
And dismembered face 

Finally 
I’ve found a host
Capable of
Containing 
My precocial 
Power
Together we will enslave


Now with my host 
We rip through the town
Infecting people 
Devouring some too 
Searching for some 
Still in the womb 
Ripped from the uterus
Stillborn placenta Stu 

With their blood 
We will sustain
An umatched power 
Beyond belief 
Once again 
Humanity 
Will become 
A symbiosis 

I will take the flesh of man as my own
Till I am the only thing that creepeth on the world 

Like a tick 
Siphoning their blood

We are the symbiote 
Masters of flesh
Benders of blood
This world we will drain

Don’t get it twisted 
This is not mutualism 
But parasitism 
And all of you are fucked

Now lay witness 
To thy carnage
