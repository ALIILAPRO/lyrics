		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sick of all these alibis
The constant pointless accusations
I wonder why I even try
I can't out run it
I don't wanna go to war
But I can't take this anymore
Baby what we fighting for
There's no use in running
Take a second think about
Everything that we have been through
Tell me what you're feeling now
Just confront it
I don't wanna go to war
I've never felt this way before
Don't you love me anymore
There's no use in running
(I don't wanna go to war)
(There's no use in running)
You're enough, you're enough
You're enough, you're enough
You're enough, you're enough
So here's my love
You're enough, you're enough
You're enough, you're enough
You're enough, you're enough
So here's my love
Cold sweats and heartbreak dear
All this and I'm still here
To the ends of the earth and the atmosphere
Rest easy and know my love's always near
