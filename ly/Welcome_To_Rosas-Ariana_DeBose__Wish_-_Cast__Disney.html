		<p>
		  Welcome to Rosas
Come on, come this way
Where the greatest creations are all on display
There's no other place just as full of surprise
Where your dreams and your reality can collide
You wanna dance on beat?
Or to have hair touch down to your feet?
Go to outer space?
Well, hey, you've come to the right place

'Cause here in the city of Rosas
You can turn all your wanting to wishing
No what-ifs and no wonders
Oh, here in the city of Rosas 
It's unlikely that you'll be unhappy
With so much to discover

A home for me (me)
For you (you)
And all of us (us)
The city of Rosas

So like, we have this king named Magnifico
And he built Rosas many years ago
With lightning for hands and eyes that can glow
No, no, no, I'm totally kidding! But he is powerful
He's just like us with a twist
And someone that I'd like to kiss (oh, dear!)
A magic swish
And there you have it, poof, there's your wish!
Ooh and, hey did I mention when you turn eighteen?
You get to give your wish in a ceremony
And he keeps them safe, every wish he acquires 
And once a month he grants someone's greatest desire 
It could be you someday or my saba Sabino's
Ooh, I can't wait!
Does it hurt?
Do you cry?
Oh, no, and you won't even miss it when you say "goodbye"

'Cause here in the city of Rosas 
You can turn all your wanting to wishing
No what-ifs and no wonders
Oh, here in the city of Rosas
It's unlikely that you'll be unhappy
With so much to discover

A home for me (me)
For you (you)
And all of us (us)
The city of Rosas
