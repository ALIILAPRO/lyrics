		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh why would you try to be so unkind
Your laughter echoes in my head
Leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone I'm reminded
Don't forget about the dead

If I could go walking with you by my side
Would you be so unkind, so unkind
You could do all the talking, just speak your mind
Free your mind

Well you found you had a voice
And the world stopped to listen
But you had nothing good to say
Now you're alone, digging for bones, buried in your phone for hours
What a waste of a day

If I could go walking with you by my side
Would you be so unkind, so unkind
You could do all the talking, just speak your mind
Free your mind

I hope you find a better way
I hope you find
I hope you find a better way
To be kinder
