		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In The Skies 

You had a vision 
Two souls in collision 
Now you’re gonna walk away 

You needed purpose 
She seemed worth it 
You’re throwing it all away 

Two souls searching for the answers 
Somewhere up in the skies are falling 
And fading away into the night 

Who will catch you when you fall 
From the skies 
Built upon all the lies 
And who will catch you when you fall 
From the skies 
Built upon all the lies 

You needed someone 
Who you could lean on 
To help you as you walked away 

Two souls searching for the answers 
Somewhere up in the skies are falling 
And fading away into the night 

Who will catch you when you fall 
From the skies 
Built upon all the lies 
And who will catch you when you fall 
From the skies 
Built upon all the lies 
And who will catch you when you fall 
From the skies 
Built upon all the lies
