		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the darkest of the night
Waiting for the light to come
When the demons in your mind
Remind you of the damage done

Always talking, so much to say
Like a haunting ghost from the grave
And heaven seems so far away
So far away
Oh, I can see it

Changes are coming
Changes are coming
Yeah, we're headed for better days
Never stop running
Changes are coming
Changes are coming

Lost and helpless, scared to death
Barely breathing, still alive
Hit the ground face down in the dirt
Never giving up when it hurts
Oh, heaven feels so far away
So get ready for the fight, get ready for war
Yeah, and never give up what you're fighting for

Changes are coming
Changes are coming
Yeah, we're headed for better days
Never stop running
Changes are coming
And we're headed for better days
Changes are coming

So get ready for the fight, get ready for war
(Get ready for the fight, get ready for war)
Yeah, and never give up what you're fighting for
(Never give up what you're fighting for)

Changes are coming
Changes are coming
Yeah, we're headed for better days
And never stop running
Changes are coming
Yeah, we're headed for better days
Oh yeah, yeah (changes are coming, coming)
Yeah, we're headed for better days
Changes are coming, coming
