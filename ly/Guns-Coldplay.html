		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it from the playgrounds 
And take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals
And squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols
With their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros
We've been doing all the sums
The judgement of this court is
We need more guns
Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Melt down all the trumpets
All the trombones and the drums
Who needs education?
Or a thousand spent at sums
Poor is good for business
Cut the forest, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes
And fuck the other ones

It's the opinion of this board that
We need more guns
Stop

Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too
