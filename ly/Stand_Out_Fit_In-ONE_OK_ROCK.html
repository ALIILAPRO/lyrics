		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know they don't like me that much
Guess that I don't dress how they want
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else

Try to color inside their lines
Try to live a life by design
I just wanna be myself
I can't be someone else
Someone else

They yell they preach
I've heard it all before
Be this be that
I've heard it before
Heard it before

Big boys don't cry
Shoot low aim high
Eat up stay thin
Stand out fit in

Good girls don't fight
Be you dress right
White face tan skin
Stand out fit in

Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in

同じことの繰り返しで
飽き飽きしている日々
ただ自分らしくありたい
ありのままで
Can't be someone else

They yell they preach
I've heard it all before
Be this be that
I've heard it before
Heard it before

Big boys don't cry
Shoot low aim high
Eat up stay thin
Stand out fit in

Good girls don't fight
Be you dress right
White face tan skin
Stand out fit in

Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in

I am who I am
No matter what
Never changing
No matter what
No matter what

Big boys don't cry
Shoot low aim high
Eat up stay thin
Stand out fit in

Good girls don't fight
Be you dress right
White face tan skin
Stand out fit in

Big boys don't cry
Shoot low aim high
Eat up stay thin
Stand out fit in

Good girls don't fight
Be you dress right
White face tan skin
Stand out fit in

Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
Stand out fit in
