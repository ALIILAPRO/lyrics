		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She took the top off
Like she ready for drive-bys
And I just popped one
So I'm in my prime
Yeah, yeah
We say we're different
But we got the same eyes
A bottle of henny, a bottle of rum 
We drink at the same time
And I'm off my face
I know I'm a drunk 
But this ain't no part time

Oh I, I think you just took me to my paradise
You look so good in red that I just died inside, call you my valentine
Though my heart ain't something I'm willing to sacrifice
Oh I, don't know where I'm going, let your curves decide
Hated and most wanted when our hearts collide
And I bet when you kiss it stings like cyanide

And that's why I bet you got a bullet with my
A bullet with my
You got a bullet with my name on it
A bullet with my name on it
And that's why I bet you got a bullet with my
A bullet with my
You got a bullet with my name on it
A bullet with my name on it
My name

And I bet that you won't miss me when I'm gone (yeah)
And I bet that you gon' leave and carry on (yeah)
And if I make it, baby, I'll put it all on red
Couple mill' in cash, I'll burn it all like we said
And I know I'm wasted, so I'm probably on my bullshit
But I fell in love when you passed eighty in that fast lane
Can't get it out of my head
And if I can't rest, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead

Oh I, I think you just took me to my paradise
You look so good in red that I just died inside, call you my valentine
Though my heart ain't something I'm willing to sacrifice
Oh I, don't know where I'm going, let your curves decide
Hated and most wanted when our hearts collide
And I bet when you bite it stings like cyanide

And that's why I bet you got a bullet with my
A bullet with my
You got a bullet with my name on it
A bullet with my name on it
And that's why I bet you got a bullet with my
A bullet with my
You got a bullet with my name on it
A bullet with my name on it
My name

And that's why I bet you got a bullet with my
A bullet with my
You got a bullet with my name on it
A bullet with my name on it
And that's why I bet you got a bullet with my
A bullet with my
You got a bullet with my name on it
A bullet with my name on it
My name
