		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see that look upon your face
Something my mind cannot erase
If we keep staring then I might have to

Might have to start to walk your way
I wanna hear what you would say
You got high standards and I do too

'Cause all those girls (They don't)
Know what you need (They don't)
But I know, I know the way, the way
To make, to make sure you never leave

If I come close baby would you like that
If I give some would you give it right back
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

Say you want love boy I know what that means
Make you feel way better than in your dreams
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

Yo, it's like that, like that
How you run it right back
Know you on the right track
Queen ace blackjack
I be thinking way too much I need to let it go
You be running through my mind
And I'ma let it show

'Cause ain't nobody stepping up to me
And saying nothing when I calling you
Be running eye to eye we never fronting, yeah
We zoning bet we stunting on and on and on and
To the top baby boy we be rolling

'Cause all those girls (They don't)
Know what you need (They don't)
But I know, I know the way, the way
To make, to make sure you never leave

If I come close baby would you like that (like that)
If I give some would you give it right back (right back)
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

Say you want love boy I know what that means
Make you feel way better than in your dreams
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

I want you in my arms
In my arms, my arms (that's where you need to be)
In my arms, in my arms
My arms (that's where you need to be)

Ah-ah, ah-ah
But I know, I know the way, the way
To make, to make sure you never leave

If I come close baby would you like that (like that)
If I give some would you give it right back (right back)
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

Say you want love boy I know what that means
Make you feel way better than in your dreams
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

If I come close baby would you like that
If I give some would you give it right back
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that

Say you want love boy I know what that means
Make you feel way better than in your dreams
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that
Baby, would you like that
