		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The future is bulletproof
The aftermath is secondary
It's time to do it now and do it loud
Killjoys, make some noise

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na

Drugs, gimme drugs
Gimme drugs, I don't need it
But I'll sell what you got
Take the cash and I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas, kill them all
And we crawl, and we crawl
And we crawl, you be my detonator

Love, gimme love
Gimme love, I don't need it
But I'll take what I want
From your heart and I'll keep it in a bag, in a box
Put an X on the floor
Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, shut up and sing it with me

Na, na, na, na, na, na (From mall security)
Na, na, na, na, na, na (To every enemy)
Na, na, na, na, na, na
We're on your property standing in V formation

Na, na, na, na, na, na (Let's blow an artery)
Na, na, na, na, na, na (Get plastic surgery)
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Keep your apology, give us more detonation

More, gimme more, gimme more

Oh, let me tell you about the sad man
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman?
Thought you was Batman and hit the party with a gas can?
Kiss me, you animal

Na, na, na, na, na, na (You run the company)
Na, na, na, na, na, na (Fuck like a Kennedy)
Na, na, na, na, na, na
I think we'd rather be burning your information

Na, na, na, na, na, na (Let's blow an artery)
Na, na, na, na, na, na (Get plastic surgery)
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Keep your apology, give us more detonation

And right here, right now
All the way in Battery City
The little children raise their open, filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven

And all the Juvie halls and the Ritalin rats
Ask angels made from neon
And fucking garbage scream out "what will save us?"
And the sky opened up

Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one, no one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try, now
I'll be your detonator

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (Make no apology)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (It's death or victory)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (On my authority)
Crash and burn, young and loaded

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (Drop like a bullet shell)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (Just like a sleeper cell)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'd rather go to hell than be in a purgatory
Cut my hair, gag and bore me
Pull this pin, let this world explode
