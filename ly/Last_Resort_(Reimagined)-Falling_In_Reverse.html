		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut my life into pieces
This is my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding
This is my last resort

Cut my life into pieces
I've reached my last resort
Suffocation, no breathing
Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?

Would it be wrong or it be right?
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide
I'm contemplating suicide

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
I am fine

I never realized I was spread too thin
'Til it was too late and I was empty within
Feeding on chaos and living in sin
Downward spiral, where do I begin?

It all started when I lost my mother
No love for myself and no love for another
To find a lover on a higher level
Finding nothing but questions and devils (devils, devils)

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing is fine

I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying

I can't go on living this way
I can't go on living this way

Cut my life into pieces
Cut my life into pieces (yeah)

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Nothing is fine

I'm running and I'm crying
I'm running and I'm crying
I'm running and I'm crying
Nothing's alright
