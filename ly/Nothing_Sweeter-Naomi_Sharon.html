		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You flow through me, movin' me (mm-hmm)
I see no walls, I fear no more
There is no place we can't go
Swimmin' in your presence
We got so far away from the surface
I ain't never been so deep
But with you, I'm ready to be

Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing hits, mm, like the first kiss
The way you make me wait
Anticipate the taste
Open up to what it is
Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing hits, mm, like the first kiss
Body and soul aligned
Your fingers runnin' down my spine
Never be as good as this

(Mm)
(Ooh-ooh)
(Mm, mm-hmm)

There is no darkness
No darkness we can't bear
There is only light
Nothing to fight when you are here
Uncover my skin, undo this pain
Unbreak my heart
Until I remember the way

Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing hits, mm, like the first kiss
The way you make me wait
Anticipate the taste
Open up to what it is
Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing hits, mm, like the first kiss
Body and soul aligned
Your fingers runnin' down my spine
Never be as good as this

Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing, nothing
Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing sweeter than this
Nothing sweeter, sweeter than this
Nothing sweeter than this
