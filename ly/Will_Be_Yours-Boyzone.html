		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na 

All that you want will be yours 
(All that you want will be yours) 

Look here now read my lips 
Focus on my fingertips 
Understand these open hands 
I give to you all that's true 

So sail away and free your ghost 
Give to whom you love the most 
Give away and you'll believe 
All good things you'll receive 

The more you give the more you get 
Always try not to forget 
So give it all away, hey

All that you want, will be yours 
Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
(All that you want, will be yours) 

If I'm the one, you lookin' for 
Then open up that bolted door 
Let me in and lead me through 
You know, I'll do the same for you 

Heart to heart, if truth is there 
Now give away and you believe 
All good things you'll receive 

The more you give, the more you get 
Always try, not to forget 
So give it all away, hey

All that you want 

The more you give, the more you get 
Always try, not to forget 
So give it all away, hey

All that you want, will be yours 

Open up your life and look at me now 
See the one who loves you 
For the one you really are 

I've been waiting for so long 
For this love to come my way 
All good things come to those who wait 
All that you want will be yours 

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na 
All that you want, will be yours 

The more you give, the more you get 
Always try, not to forget 
So give it all away, hey
All that you want 

The more you give, the more you get 
Always try, not to forget 
So give it all away, hey

All that you want
Will be yours 

All that you want will be yours
