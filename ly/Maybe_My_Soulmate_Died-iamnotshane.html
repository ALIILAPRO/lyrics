		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never got your number
Am I reading into your smile
Or am I reading between your lips
Was that a spark am I imagining this?

Maybe you got somewhere to be
And I'm afraid of what the answer will be
So instead
I watch you leave

Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know
Maybe I don't have a soul
What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by

What if I never let you in
And now you're with somebody who did
All of this miscommunication, indecisiveness, be patient

Not the type to take a risk
But now I'm worried I'll regret this
It's a fear of rejection
It's a hope for redemption

Maybe you got somewhere to be
And I'm afraid of what the answer will be
Instead
I watch you leave

Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know
Maybe I don't have a soul
What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by

What if I never let you in
And now you're with somebody who did
All of this miscommunication, indecisiveness, be patient

Always second guessing
Always second guessing
Always second guessing
Always second guessing

Maybe my soulmate died, I don't know
Maybe I don't have a soul
What if I saw you on the train last night and I just walked on by
