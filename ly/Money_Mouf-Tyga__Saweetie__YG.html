		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two racks, I'ma blow that (yeah)
Three, four, five, I'ma hold that (hold that)
Six, seven, eight, I'ma show that (show that)
Nine, ten, racks, I'ma throw that (OG Parker)

Ayy, bounce that ass, yeah, throw it back (throw it back)
Spend that cash, you got hella racks (hella racks)
Run that back, nigga, no cap (no cap)
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at (mouth at)
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth

What's up lil' bitch, I invented racks (racks)
Brought a Brinks truck, bitch in love with that (skrr, skrr)
Bitch I'm a king, like I'm playin' sack (ball)
The bitch tryna play me, I'ma play her back (bih)
Bitch hoppin' on my dick like a Jambo Jack
I'ma pay for her ass, I don't like it flat (no)
I invest in you, I'ma get the money back (yeah)
You know I got the Midas Touch, ta-da-da (yeah)
I know you wanna fuck a rapper, fuck an athlete (yeah)
Runnin' to the studio like a track meet
And I need a fat ass, it's a Black thing
Got a Chinese bitch, it's a Ling-Ling

One, two racks, I'ma blow that (yeah)
Three, four, five, I'ma hold that (hold that)
Six, seven, eight, I'ma show that (show that)
Nine, ten, racks, I'ma throw that

Ayy, bounce that ass, yeah, throw it back (throw it back)
Spend that cash, you got hella racks (hella racks)
Run that back, nigga, no cap (no cap)
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at (mouth at)
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth

Yeah
When I'm countin', I don't wanna speak (uh-uh)
Runnin' games for seven days, man this nigga weak
Ooh, I love sloppy toppy but my Henny neat (mwah)
Got the hottest nigga in the A between my sheets (palms itchin')
You know Saweetie bad bitchin'
Triple plat' pussy, so you know it hit different (pah-pah-pah)
Big crib, peep how your baby livin'
If a nigga broke in, I wouldn't notice shit missin'
A bitch mad in the mirror 'cause she ain't me (ain't me)
Girl, I passed on your man, you should thank me (better thank me)
I'ma cold lil' piece, they should paint me
If I ran from the bank, it'd chase me (vroom)

One, two racks, I don't want that (hmm, hmm)
Three, four racks, I pour that (yeah)
Five, six, shit I might hold that (what?)
Cashin' out on ones and throw that (bitch)

Ayy, bounce that ass, yeah, throw it back (throw it back)
Spend that cash, you got hella racks (hella racks)
Run that back, nigga, no cap (no cap)
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at (mouth at)
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth

All that ass in those jeans
I'm tryna get between
She ain't happy at home
That's how this lil' bitch got stole
Me and T in matchin' Lambs, we gon' fuck it up (fuck it up, sis)
Do the gingerbread man, we gon' run it up (run it up, sis)
Got a natural lil' thang, and she bad as fuck (and she bad)
She gon' hit the gym, fuck a tummy tuck (fuck)
Fuck your ex nigga, fuck your next nigga (ayy)
I'm your right now nigga, I'm your best nigga (I'm your best, nigga)
I wanna pay for everything and have sex with you
Your old thang told you no, I'm your yes nigga (yes)

One, two racks, I'ma blow that (yeah)
Three, four, five, I'ma hold that (hold that)
Six, seven, eight, I'ma show that (show that)
Nine, ten, racks, I'ma throw that

Ayy, bounce that ass, yeah, throw it back (throw it back)
Spend that cash, you got hella racks (hella racks)
Run that back, nigga, no cap (no cap)
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at (mouth at)
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth at
Ayy, is you 'bout that?
Put your money where your mothafuckin' mouth
