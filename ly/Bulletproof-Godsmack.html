		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Contemplating, isolating
And it's stressing me out
Different visions, contradictions
Why won't you let me out?

I need a way to separate yeah
But I promise you that I'll make sure you never forget me
(Never forget me)

Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof
Believe me, I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone

You're addicted and so twisted
That it's freaking me out
Distant eyes, it's no surprise
You can't do anything now

I need a way to separate yeah
But I'm telling you that nothing will ever be the same

Now that you want it
Now that you need it
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof
Believe me, I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone

(Now that you want it)
(Now that you need it)
I'm too far gone
You're trying to blame me
But I'm not breaking
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof
Believe me, I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone
I'm telling you, I'm bulletproof
Believe me, I'm bulletproof
You make me so bulletproof
And now I'm too far gone
