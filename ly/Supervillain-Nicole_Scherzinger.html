		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I need a super villain
Just like Mad Scientist

I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone

I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone

Hey, although, no, no

The one men flies
'Cause I keep what, to see
They're my kinda guy
But they ain't my cup of tea
The cuddies and jeans on
Swaggers, so mean
Oh, you know what I mean
(I just want bad man alone)

Though, I know they're bad for my soul
Oh, I just can't leave 'em alone
(I just want bad man alone)
See the heroes were never my type
I need the boys who care the nights right

I need a super villain to come and rescue me
I'm feeling this right 'cause they can save me
That's why I need a super villain to come and rescue me
I'm feeling this right these bad boys,
Boys, they're driving me crazy

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Super super bad
Super bad
Super super bad

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Bad boys're driving me crazy
Super bad, bad

Oh, so you can try to save me from love
But I rather have that he's chains and handcuffs
Make me his prisoner
Er, er.

So, wanna be Louis and Clark
Wanna be Bonnie and Clyde
Cause I ride or die

Although, I know they're bad for my soul
Oh I just cant leave 'em alone
And see the good boys aren't my type
I like them boys in the dark side

I need a super villain to come and rescue me
I'm feeling this right 'cause they can save me
That's why I need a super villain to come and rescue me
I'm feeling this right these bad boys
Boys, they're driving me crazy

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Super super bad
Super bad
Super super bad

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Bad boys're driving me crazy
Super bad, bad
Oh!

I need a super villain to come and rescue me
I'm feeling this right 'cause they can save me
That's why I need a super villain to come and rescue me
I'm feeling this right these bad boys,
Boys, they're driving me crazy

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Super super bad
Super bad
Super super bad

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Bad boys're driving me crazy
Super bad, bad

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Super super bad
Super bad
Super super bad

I want him super, super bad
Super bad
Super super bad
Bad boys're driving me crazy
Super bad, bad

I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone

I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
I just want batman alone
