		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems more and more the future's filled with uncertainty we seem to find ourselves living in an age of anxiety I know, we go, on living fearfully the leaders of the world won't realize their responsibility I say, I say will we get blown away can we go on existing hoping for another day one day, one day, we can get blown away or we can stop the madness before it's too late and we get blown away you tell me that you're scared well so am I we'll never get any answers asking the question why we can't, romance, keep living day to day we all must find some way to overcome the apathy I know, we go, on living fearfully we can't, romance, keep living day to day I know that many say there seems to be no way there's no deceiving me apearance is not reality death is the end of life ah, why should life all labour be let us alone; time driveth onward fast let us alone; what is it that will last? let us alone; what pleasure can we have to war with evil? is their any peace
