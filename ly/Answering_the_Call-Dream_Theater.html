		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White walls glisten
Empires, crimson
Aching within
Raging fire

Sovereign, asphyxiate
No conscience
A solemn state
Misguide, indoctrinate
Accepted long held views

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust in love and peace?
Burns bright for us
When will the long-held truth be cast aside?
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Decisions by which to act
Programmed, no turning back
Call upon a switch turned on
An ultimate price to pay

Weeping mother too late to cry
Hold the truth, can't ignore the lie
Time to look it in the eye

When will there be a day when all of us
Trust and know in love and peace
When will the long held truth be cast aside
Embrace our fellow man, no longer vilified

Radiant, we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Illuminating all
Answering the call

Fight or flight, both threatening
Hidden thoughts are deafening
Your guilt feeding the flame
Tearful knowing it's a lie
Desired might just past you by
Rituals, your funeral pyre

Scars you can't erase
If you choose to face
There is beauty in us all
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
The writing's on the wall
Will you wager your life?

Radiant, we'll shine
Heart and soul, one mind
Walk the higher ground
There you will be found
Illuminating all
Answering the call
Answering the call
