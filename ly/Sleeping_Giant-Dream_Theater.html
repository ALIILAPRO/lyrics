		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some will be driven by conflict
Others will fight the good fight
Some will rely on the darkness
Some will rely on the light
Some elevate with compassion
Yearning for knowledge and peace
Some motivate through aggression
Selfishly serve their own needs

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

People will obsess
With suffering and death
Questioning their own desires
This morbid fascination
Renders us possessed
By our violent and destructive side

When we lay our armor down
Fragments of our love
Slip through the cracks of hate
But the raging storm below
Will never go away
If it is not embraced

Shadows disappear at night
Buried out of fear
Driven underground
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a ticking bomb
That doesn't make a sound

Shadows disappear at night
Harmless as a dove
Clever like a snake
Hidden lies the rage inside
Like a sleeping giant
One we dare not wake

Standing under the eclipse
Are we sheltered and concealed
Or bathing in its glow?

Our desires and ambitions
And our need to believe
There is good in this world
Spin a common thread
