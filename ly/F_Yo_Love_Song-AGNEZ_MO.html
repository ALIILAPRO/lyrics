		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought that I was all you wanted
I thought that you would keep it one hundred
I thought that I could make you love it
Thought that you would put a ring on it
But I was so dumb dumb stupid
How could I be so foolish
Now you 'bout to make me lose it
Like yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Sunday you love me Monday you said you'd be there
Tuesday you hide Wednesday you lied baby you ain't playing fair
Thursday you didn't even call Friday you had me on the floor
Saturday's just another day baby you make a fool of me yeah

I never loved you anyway
Was sleeping with the enemy
And now I'm not the one to play with
So now I'm saying fuck your love song
You don't know who you're dealing with
I shoulda known you wasn't shit
I finally can take a break so
So now I'm saying fuck your love song

Fuck your love song
Fuck your love song
Fuck your fuck your love song
Fuck your love song
Fuck your fuck your love song

I don't have to let down my guard
All my girls are telling me that you would break my heart
Can't believe that you was dumb enough to go get caught
Why did you have to do me so damn dirty
Uh uh that ain't my style
To go and give a man attention night and day come on
So now I'm saying bye-bye with a smile like
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Sunday you love me Monday you said you'd be there
Tuesday you hide Wednesday you lied baby you ain't playing fair
Thursday you didn't even call Friday you had me on the floor
Saturday's just another day baby you make a fool of me yeah

I never loved you anyway
Was sleeping with the enemy
And now I'm not the one to play with
So now I'm saying fuck your love song
You don't know who you're dealing with
I shoulda known you wasn't shit
I finally can take a break so
So now I'm saying fuck your love song

Fuck your love song
Fuck your love song
Fuck your fuck your love song
Fuck your love song
Fuck your love song
Fuck your fuck your love song
Fuck your love song

So now I'm saying fuck your love song

Fuck your love song
Fuck your fuck your love song
Fuck your love song
Fuck your fuck your love song
