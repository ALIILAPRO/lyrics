		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven heaven

Feels like God himself is under my tongue
Thankful, I found the Lord
While I'm still young
He won't open up his gates for just anyone

Floating up, touching the ceiling
How the hell are we still breathing?
Never had much to believe in
But I think I'm seeing

Heaven heaven

I'm searching for meaning in distractions
Keep fucking up my life, guess shit happens
Everytime I blink, life is passing

Floating up, touching the ceiling
How the hell are we still breathing?
Never had much to believe in
But I think I'm seeing

Heaven heaven
Heaven heaven

Heaven heaven
