		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You pushed the boundaries of this world
My head was leaning on the wall
I closed my eyelids and I saw you
Our two shapes waltzing in the snow 

Is this day meant to be remembered?
Will I one day forget your name?
Are you the wind that blows my words?
Are you the drugs that I have chased?

Ludlow Street is the witness 
Of your missing footsteps in the snow
All the neighborhood has been swallowed 
up by a white cloud filled with hope

You pushed the boundaries of this world
My head was leaning on the wall
I closed my eyelids and I saw you
Our two shapes waltzing in the snow 
Our two shapes waltzing in the snow 

Sleep monster, the future's coming
I'm just an empty bottle in the night 
I was just gone for a night ride
To a place where fever has no end
