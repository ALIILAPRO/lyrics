		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"

So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter, you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly
(Fuck it, I love you)

I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
It turns out everywhere you go you take yourself, that's not a lie
(Fuck it, I love you)
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly
(Fuck it, I love you)

California dreamin', I got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Drugs is in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', I got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Drugs is in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', I got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Drugs is in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', I got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Drugs is in my veins, running out of time
