		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  YOU 
HAVE BEEN CHOSEN 
TO BE A MARTYR 
TO BE AN EXPERIMENT

YOU 
WILL BE THE VICTIM
SUBJECTED TO ENDLESS TORTURE

I CAN SEE YOUR FACE TWISTING WITH FEAR
WITH YOUR EYES PLUNGED INTO ME
AND YOU CAN SCREAM CAUSE NO ONE'S HERE
TO PULL YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY

THE THRILL OF THE GAME
IS TO DRIVE TO INSANE
AND THE PRICE YOU WILL PAY
IS TO GIVE YOUR LIFE AWAY
A LUCID NIGHTMARE
YOURE SINKING INTO DESPAIR
THE GRAND OPENING OF YOUR AGONY


I CAN SEE
YOU REACHED THE APOGEE
THE DEMONS ENTERED YOUR SOUL 
YOU ARE NOTHING

THE TERROR PENETRATES YOUR BRAINS
I KNOW YOUR LOSING GRIP 
THIS ONLY IS THE BEGINNING
THE PRELUDE TO YOUR SUFFERING

THE  DESCENT BEGINS
AND YOUR SOUL STARTS TO BURN
LIKE THE PAIN OF THE FLESH ASUNDERED FROM THE BONES
DELUSIONAL VISIONS
OF INHUMAN BEINGS
CRAWLING IN THE MIST OF THIS MADNESS BESTOWED 

YOUR LIFE SLIPS AWAY
A NEW REALITY APPEARS
THE DEMONS EATING YOUR SOUL
SACRED MARTYR

YOU REACH THE TRANSCENDENT DEATH
YOU GASP YOUR LAST BREATH
RECONCIALITION 
OF THE BEGINNING AND THE END
I FEED ON YOUR CRIES IN VAIN
I SWALLOW YOUR PAIN
HELD IN ABEYANCE
ARCANE KNOWLEDGE IS MINE
