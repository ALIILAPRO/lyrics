		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you're listening
I so far dedicated this entire album for you
All these songs that you are listening to is about us
Tired of feeling this way
I told myself that I'll be okay
That was until our love starts to fade
Fade
Fade
Tired of feeling this way
I told myself that I'll be okay
That was until our love starts to fade
Fade
Fade
I think of you every single day
Thinking of you puts a smile on my face
But then I think back to all my pain
I loved you but you didn't feel the same
Was my time and money just a game
You left me to cry in the rain
Baby why didn't you love me the same
Why didn't love me the same
Tired of feeling this way
I told myself that I'll be okay
That was until our love starts to fade
Fade
Fade
Tired of feeling this way
I told myself that I'll be okay
That was until our love starts to fade
Fade
Fade
I think of you every single day
Thinking of you puts frown on my face
Because all you did was rain on parades
And I'm tired of feeling this way
I-I'm really tired of feeling the way that you made me feel because I showed you so much love and time
I put so much into you just to find out I can lose it all in one second
What I felt was real
I really wish it was the same for you, but maybe it doesn't always go both ways
But in the end
I still love you
