		<p>
		  Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
I can't escape
Being afraid
Fill me with you right now
My world needs you right now

Show me your face
Fill up this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
I can't escape
Being afraid
Fill me with you right now
My world needs you right now

Power fall down
Bring with it a sound
That points us to you right now
Erase substitutes right now
Fix what I see
And God please fix me
My world needs you right now
Let us see you right now

Power fall down
Bring with it a sound
That points us to you right now
Erase substitutes right now
Fix what I see (and God please fix me)
And God please fix me
My world needs you right now
Let us see you right now

Every heart in the world, God, needs you to rescue
Storms have come and torn our hearts in two
We need you

Show me your face
Fill up this space (the world needs)
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now

Storms may come but when we call your name
All things change
Kingdoms fall 
One thing forever reigns 
Is your name
The anchor that holds me in my pain stays the same
(Oh, how sweet) Oh, how sweet to know that your great name
Will never change 
(That's why I'm not ashamed to say)

Jesus, (oh)
Jesus, (nobody like you Jesus)
Jesus, (power is in the name Jesus)
Jesus, (yes I need you)
Jesus, (that's where the power is)
Jesus, (you have all of the authority)
Jesus
(Only you are the great, I am, you're the king of kings, you're the lord of lords, that's why)

Storms may come, but when we call your name all things change
Kingdoms fall, one thing forever reigns, is your name
Oh, how sweet to know that your great name will never change
It stays the same

Show me your face
Come fill this space
My world needs you right now
My world needs you right now
