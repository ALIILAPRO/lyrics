		  Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
I don't like nobody, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
I don't like nobody, I don't like nobody

What up? What up? You ain't fazin' me
You know pussy run the show, VIP
I's a pretty young thing, call it P-Y-T
Got these bitches all mad, on the M-A-D
If the money ain't there, got to B-Y-E
S-sorry little mama got to G2G
Got a price on his head for the E-Y-E
I'm settin' bombs on these niggas, y'all can D-I-E, uh
Hood bitch, fashion would adore me
I does what I do, all y'all sucka bitches corny
I don't like the style so you move kinda phony
And lemme tell you again, I don't need a homie
Live my life alone, 'cause lonely is the only
Rather eat by myself than dine with bologna
I'm a B-I-T-C-H, bitch
Rather be a whore than be known as a snitch
Rather die for honor and dig my own ditch
I'm a girl from the street on my Hollywood shit
Zenon the Zequel, little Spanish flavor
Left home at 16, I been stackin' paper
See, I been on my grind and I been gettin' paid
17 was the year, you know the checks that I made?
I think I had it comin', since 18 I was ready
I had swag like Escobar, straight down from the ghetty
Pinky finger, I don't wanna be a pop star
Ring finger, wanna pull up in a fast car
Middle finger in the air, fuck you
Trigger finger ready, ain't nowhere to run to
Pointer finger but you never point a finger
Rap green thumb, you know Wavy do deliver
Malibu Barbie and I was a Theresa
Baby Spanish fly, East Side senorita
I be cuttin' checks like it was a pizza
You know how I do, boricua Lolita
I'm a bad girl and I take what I want
That's your baby papi callin' and he tryna eat it up
You call my friend and he say what's what
And if he get paid then you know I get a cut
Wavy always get a cut, uh
Say what? Say what? Say what? Say what?
Like to smoke alone and I don't like soda
Carbonate a fifth, use a day-old cola
Don't like carbs and I don't like calories
Like my salad green with the top-grade celery
Skinny little bitch, got your favorite nigga fannin' me
He my side nigga, know these niggas ain't a man to me
Know these niggas ain't a man to me
Uh, uh, uh

Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
I don't like nobody, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
I don't like nobody, I don't like nobody

Barbie, Theresa, Lisa Frank
I don't got no friends 'cause they all act fake
Smile up in your face but they move like snakes
Silly little girls who ain't got no taste
Pepe, Baby Phat, Lady and Michi
On another planet said that light-skin impeached me
Study all men and I learn from their mistakes
You gon' stay on bein' average, I'ma come off with the bank
Got no friends, ain't nothin' to break off
Marie Antoinette when it's time to cake off
I'm from New York, you know Harlem is my city
'Bout to shake it off like Mase, Cam, and Diddy
'Bout to kill it first, then get to the nitty-gritty
I was with the fellas on the benches lookin' pretty
Aha, aha, aha, ah

Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
I don't like nobody, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
I don't like nobody, I don't like nobody

Versace hottie, I don't like nobody
