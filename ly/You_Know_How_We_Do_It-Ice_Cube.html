		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Fool, you know how we do it

West Side
Comin' from the West Side
Nothin' but the West Side

Ain't nothin' goin on but the bomb ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster ass tricks sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox up at Venice
They want to have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo' hoppin, ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My truth can, ill, fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Comin' from the West Side
West Side, comin' from the West Side

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan, who got a plot
Whom got got, and who got shot
'Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin out the window
Fool, I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, Planet of the Apes
I'm down with Eiht, and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want "The Bomb," just like George Clinton
S-K-D is down to catch a body
Put on Knee Deep, we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

You know how we do it

Jack B Nimble, and Jack B Quick
If you want to jack me on a lick, 'cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You think you stuck yourself, with a number two pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With "Mo' Bounce to the Ounce" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin a glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it

Comin' from the West Side, West Side
Nothin' but a West Side
It's hittin' on the West Side
Fool, you know how we do it
