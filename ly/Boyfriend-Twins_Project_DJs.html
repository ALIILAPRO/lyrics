		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Other babes keep looking at my boyfriend
Yeah I know he is cute, but he is taken
Other babes keep looking at my boyfriend
If you know what's best you'll shove it, close it, leave it, bye
Boyfriend
Other babes keep looking at my boyfriend
Other babes keep looking at my boyfriend
Yeah I know he is cute, but he is taken
Other babes keep looking at my boyfriend
If you know what's best you'll shove it, close it, leave it, bye
Boyfriend
Other babes keep looking at my boyfriend
