		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not just another dance song
This that, "Baby did you leave ya man home?"
'Cause I'm tryna party like I'm grown
I'm tryna get the lap dance with my eyes closed, yeah
You my type, my type and I'm starving
I think you fit my appetite
Kan you live up to the hype?
I be cautious, I clean you up with the Wet Wipes
She a stripper, but she bad tho
Got back on her feet
She was doing bad though
Made it out the struggle
I respect her hustle, yeah
Fuck it, put her in a mansion, yeah
Fuck it, make sure the Rollie matching, yeah
If you an independent woman, yeah
Mercedes Benz, Celine bag
You ain't ever gotta tell her
And she know she bad

Let me see you, no hands
Let me see you pop it like rubber bands
Kan you make me feel like the man?
Kan you sit it all in my right hand?
Uh ohh
Pop it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

Yeah she moving kinda fast though (fast though)
I'm tryna keep up, but I don't wanna crash though (crash though)
Baby got back though
She the type you sneak out the back door
Show me what you working with, drop it down, do a split
Damn girl, you bad as shit
She a vegan, but she still thick
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Westside G, bitch, big spender, big tipper
Grab the ones, bring the liquor
Lemme rap to ya in the basement, Big Tigger
And Jay got B and I'm YG, pop that on me
Jay got B and I'm YG, girl pop that pussy on me

Let me see you, no hands
Let me see you pop it like rubber bands
Kan you make me feel like the man?
Kan you sit it all in my right hand?
Uh ohh
Pop it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it

All my independent ladies, go'n shake something, go 'head
Shake something 'til ya break something, oh yeah
Twerk something, baby, twerk something, go head
Shake something, baby, shake something
All my independent ladies, go'n shake something, go 'head
Shake something 'til ya break something, oh yeah
Twerk something, baby, twerk something
Twerk, twerk something, lemme know you worth something

Let me see you, no hands
Let me see you pop it like rubber bands
Kan you make me feel like the man?
Kan you sit it all in my right hand?
Uh ohh
Pop it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, pop it, shake it
Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, pop it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it
