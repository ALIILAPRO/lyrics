		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you all

Running out of ways to run
I can't see, I can't be
Over and over and under my skin
All this attention is doing me in

Fuck it all fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong don't exist
Don't give a shit
Don't ever judge me

Picking through the parts exposed
Taking shape, taking shag
Over and over and under my skin
All this momentum is doing me in

Fuck it all fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong don't exist
Don't give a shit
Don't ever judge me

And don't you fuckin judge me

Pain

You got all my love, livin' in your own hate
Drippin' hole man, hard step, no fate
Show you nothin', but I ain't holdin' back
Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
When I get my hands on you
Ain't a fucking thing you can do
Get this 'cause you're never gonna get me
I am the very disease you pretend to be

I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move
I am the push that makes you move

Fuck it all fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong don't exist
Don't give a shit
Don't ever judge me

Fuck it all fuck this world
Fuck everything that you stand for
Don't belong don't exist
Don't give a shit
Don't ever judge me
