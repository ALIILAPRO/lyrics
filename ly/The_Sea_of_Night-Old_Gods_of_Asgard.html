		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Sea of Night raging fire in our veins
As life will wax and wane
Like music we'll hear your waves once more
And sail to another shore

The gold of a silent past, the moon in silver cast
It's shine a vision quest, for us it gives no rest
Through the beat of time, the flowing waves of rhyme
We are guided by, Odin's all seeing eye, the all seeing eye

The Sea of Night running dark in our veins
As life will wax and wane
Like music we'll hear your waves once more
And sail to another shore
Northern shore

On the dreaming sea, where darkness sets us free
Free of our worldly cares, we become corsairs
And into wondrous worlds, we go with sails unfurled
To battles, lost and won, to madness and beyond, we go beyond

The Sea of Night running dark in our veins...

On the branches of life's tree, witness reality
Split up into myriad lives, beyond all divides
We have been warriors, poets and elder gods
Brought back a bounty to our homeland and you

The Sea of Night raging fire in our veins...
