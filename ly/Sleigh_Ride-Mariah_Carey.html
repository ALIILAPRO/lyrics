		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Da-gi-gi-boom)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding) mmm
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ding-dingling too
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling "Yoo hoo"
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
With you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)

(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
With you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)

With you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
With you (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding) oh
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding) oh
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding) oh
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding) ooh, ooh

Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy and cozy are we
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you
(Ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Yeah (ring-a-ling-a ding-dong-ding)
Ring-a-ding-ding (ring-a-ling-a ding)
Oh (dong)
Whoa (ding)
