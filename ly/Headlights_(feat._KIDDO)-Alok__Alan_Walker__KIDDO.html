		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, I'm gonna use every heartbeat
Oh, oh, today not tomorrow
Oh, oh, I'm gonna disobey
Oh, oh, far from the shallows

Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights

Baby, I'm all about headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights

Oh, oh, I got a taste of the good life
Oh, oh, I'm never letting go
Oh, I'm a cat, gotta use all my nine lives
Whoa, oh, I'm gonna do it all

And oh, I'm tipping on the edge
And oh, I don't wanna be scared
And oh, don't you pull the brakes
And oh, just take me all the way

Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Blinded by, blinded by headlights
Running in, running in headlights
Light me up, light me up, headlights

Baby, I'm all about headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Baby, I'm all about headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights
Headlights, headlights, headlights

(Oh, oh, I got a taste of the good life)
(Oh, oh, I'm never letting go)
