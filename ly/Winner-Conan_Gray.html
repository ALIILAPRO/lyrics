		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Packed my bags at fourteen
I hadn't planned on leaving
But you haven't been back home for days
The pots and pans and roaches
They're glad I'm finally goin'
'Cause, even them, they shudder at your name

You don't really want to hear the truth, do you?
It's obvious to anyone who ever knew you
That all you ever want is to be right
Even if that means you gotta lie to do it
The only thing you've proven

Is that there's no one 
Who ever has done better
At making me feel worse
Now you really are the winner
Yeah, there's nothing
That ever did quite kill me
More than what you did
Now you really are the winner
Take a bow 'cause you're the winner
You're the winner

Bask inside your victory
My heart that once was beating
Bleeding in the palm of your hand
Yet, you have the nerve to miss me
How do I somehow feel guilty?
When you're the one who let it get this bad

You don't really want to hear the truth, do you?
It's obvious to anyone who ever knew you
That all you ever wanted was to fight
I was only tryin' to survive your chaos
Well, look at how it's paid off

'Cause now there's no one
Who ever has done better
At making me feel worse
Now you really are the winner (winner)
Yeah, there's nothing
That ever did quite kill me
More than what you did
Now you really are the winner (winner)
Take a bow 'cause you're the winner

You're the winner
You're the winner

'Cause you don't really want to hear the truth, do you?
