		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear the words you speak when the west wind whispers
I can hear your voice ring clear in the evergreens
Am I who you thought I'd be? Am I what you pictured?
Did you have me standin' here in your wildest dreams?

Ohh-oh
Just like a memory
You never left me
You just left too soon

I'll save you a seat next to me
You're always at the table
Hope you're proud of what you see
Watchin' with the angels
You're written in my soul
It's your blood that I bleed
Wherever you are, wherever I'll be
I'll save you a seat

I feel you in the rain that falls, oh, I still get shivers
Runnin' like our family car down Corvidae
Did you find mom up there? Tell me are you with her?
I wonder if the ones who go miss the ones who stay

Ohh-oh
Just like a memory
You never left me
You just left too soon

I'll save you a seat next to me
You're always at the table
Hope you're proud of what you see
Watchin' with the angels
You're written in my soul
It's your blood that I bleed
Wherever you are, wherever I'll be
I'll save you a seat

Keep your room like nothing's changed
Try to love but it's not the same
I damn near broke when I heard your name
You had to go, you couldn't stay

So I'll save you a seat next to me
You're always at the table
Hope you're proud of what you see
Watchin' with the angels
