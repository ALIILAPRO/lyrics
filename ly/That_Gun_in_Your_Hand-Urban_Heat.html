		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey there, son,
you wanna be a man?
Put this gun in your hand.

Help 'em see the light.
Help them understand
with that gun in your hand.

You wanna make your mom,
make your daddy proud
with that gun in your hand?

They're gonna say your name.
They're gonna say it loud
with that gun in your hand.

There's no way you will mistake
that awful sound.
Say your Prayers. Hold your breath
and pray they put their guns on the
ground.

You wanna find your place,
wanna make your mark
with that gun in your hand?

You wanna shine a light,
shine a light in the dark
with that gun in your hand.

I said "don't, don't, don't
shy away from your love!
Dont', don't, don't
shy away from your love
with that gun in your hand."

There's no way you will mistake
that awful sound.
Say your Prayers. Hold your breath
and put your guns on the ground.

Let's put our guns on the ground.
