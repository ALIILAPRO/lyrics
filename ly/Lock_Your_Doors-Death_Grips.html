		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got some shit ta say just for the fuck of it
Them thangs, them thangs, don't even ask me

Corner of my eye the coroner's here, why under pressure I?

My backbone slip left to the death
Massive procession of cold sweat
Stalactite step, slide through you're next
Get me inside, I'll do the rest

Master of self-contained combust
Sustained disgust command him claim
Figure eight strut can't be touched
Subversive infiltration reign supreme, in none me trust
Why must them fuck them

Mine vomit stain dem feel not but hate dem
Line up back facin' suspense rapes dem
One-by-one hot cumshot clip spray dem
Life drop and waste dem in pine box laid dem ta
Grime dismantled churn the fat
Light the candle burn the wax
Before me dies in scorch uprise
Can't deny it, no way back

I got some shit ta say just for the fuck of it
Them thangs, them thangs, don't even ask me

Invoke ancient locc to the brain in a blaze ignition weightless world
Warped rotation path is blurred memento mori, dead man's curve

Oblivion transcender becomes him shroud
I can't remember, I'm no one now
Comin' for yours lock your doors
Identifier destroyer

Comon stick me, cut me, drain me, suck me, drink me, take me down
Feel me one, three make your chamber pound and drown

I got some shit ta say just for the fuck of it
Them thangs, them thangs
Don't even ask me

Bear the mark, take one to know, lifted chin face don't show
