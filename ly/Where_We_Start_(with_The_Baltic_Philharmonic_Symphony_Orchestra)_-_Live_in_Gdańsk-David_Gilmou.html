		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where we start is where we end
We step out sweetly, nothing planned
Along by the river we feed bread to the swans
And then over the footbridge to the woods beyond

We walk ourselves weary, you and I
There's just this moment

I light a campfire away from the path
We lie in the bluebells, a woodpecker laughs

Time passes slowly our hearts entwined
All of the dark times left behind

The day is done
The sun sinks low
We fold up the blanket, it's time to go

We walk ourselves weary, arm in arm
Back through the twilight
Home again

We waltz in the moonlight and the embers glow
So much behind us
Still far to go
