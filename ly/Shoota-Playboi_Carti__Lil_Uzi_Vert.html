		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Now, now is my time
Now is my time
(That-that-that-that-that-that be Maaly Raw)

Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score, like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in the Lambo' doors go up, not on the bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walkin' with a bustdown
Pull up and I'm flooding with a iced out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl that's check-free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie, someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie, link up make a check bleed
You know that I'm smokin' dope, I'll be high 'til next week
Know I had to let her go, 'cause she can't arrest me

Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do?
Uh, meet me in the alley with the troops
Uh, I got red shooters, I got blue
Let that thing down and point at you
Uh, Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose
Ooh, we gon' rob the bank, bring the loot
Uh, uh, we gon' take these boys back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes

Uh, money on the floor just like some shoes
Yeah, I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop, huh
Yeah, I'ma fuck your thot, she just a swoop, huh, yeah
And I love my goons, yeah, and I love my tool, (yeah) yeah (yeah)
And I love my loot (what?), yeah
Fuck with me and you gon' lose (what?)
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude
Don't talk to me, just talk to my lil' dude

Uh, woke up with my toolie, what it do?
Uh, meet me in the alley with the troops
Uh, I got red shooters, I got blue
Let that thing down and point at you
Uh, Bentley or the 'Rari, ho, let's choose
Ooh, we gon' rob the bank, bring the loot
Uh, uh, we gon' take these boys back to school
Money on the floor just like some shoes
