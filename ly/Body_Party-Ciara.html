		  Ah, oh, ah, ah (EarDrummers)
Yeah (Mike Will Made-It)
Like that
No, right there
I'm just having fun
I hope you're having fun too
Listen to this

My body is your party, baby
Nobody's invited but you, baby
I can do it slow now, tell me what you want
Baby, put your phone down, you should turn it off
'Cause tonight it's going down, tell your boys it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop, ooh

You can't keep your hands off me, touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you, your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, oh

Boy, you should know that your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it, I want it all the time
Boy, you should know that your love is always on my mind
And I can't it deny it, I want you, I'm on you

I can't lie, I won't lie, it's amazing
My faces, the places, you're taking me

Baby, take your time now, there's no need to rush
We can go another round, if that's what you want
'Cause tonight is going down, yeah, you know it's going down
We in the zone now, don't stop, ooh-oh

You can't keep your hands off me, touch me right there, rock my body
I can't keep my hands off you, your body is my party
I'm doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, oh

Boy, you should know that your love is always on my mind
I'm not gonna fight it, I want it all the time
Boy, you should know that your love is always on my mind
And I can't deny it, I want you, I'm on you

The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
I'm having so much fun with you
Now it's just me and you
Your body's my party, let's get it started, oh
