		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you can get away with anything
Because I'll be okay with it
Feeling so relaxed with you right now, baby
I just want to stay with it (Ah)
It's okay 'cause I've learned to be looser
(Learned to be looser)
I just hope I don't end up a loser
Going in the right direction, baby
I just gotta wait for it

I can't help it, you're in my soft spot
My heart melted, you made a soft spot
I can't help it
(I can't help it) , you're in my soft spot
My heart melted
(My heart melted) , you made a soft spot

I'd rather spend my time hanging with you
Than trying to get to know another
(They're not like you)
I'm learning to control my feelings
I know I have a tendency to smother
How you smile when you're with me
Tells me all I need to know that
You still got some feelings to discover

I can't help it, you're in my soft spot
My heart melted, you made a soft spot
I can't help it
(I can't help it) , you're in my soft spot
My heart melted
(My heart melted) , you made a soft spot

I can't help it, woah oh
I can't help it, woah oh

It's okay it's okay

I can't help it, you're in my soft spot
My heart melted, you made a soft spot
I can't help it, you're in my soft spot
My heart melted, you made a soft spot

I can't help it, woah oh, ah
I can't help it, woah oh
