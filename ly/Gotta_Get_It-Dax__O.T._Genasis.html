		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
It's Dax

I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
Went and did it
Tricked and flipped it and now
We bought a whip
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
Went and did it
Tricked and flipped it and now
We bought a whip (It's Dax)

Woke up, went and got myself a bag
MC on the label bunch of zeros on the tag
Swear the boy was broke
I used to pull off in the cab
Used to clean the toilets now
I'm drifting in a jag woah, gimme that
If you got work nigga send me that
Gucci, Louie
Prada put it on my babymama then I
Wanna had to go and cap a fanny bag
Money cap the fanny bag
Niggas hella mad, why?
Because I came from the bottom
Nothing to something your nigga be stunting
They walking then running and now
They can't stop 'em

I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
Went and did it
Tricked and flipped it and now
We bought a whip
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
Went and did it
Tricked and flipped it and now
We bought a whip (It's Dax)

Woke up in the morning brushed my
Teeth and scratched my ass
Bowl in the pack with them grams in a glass
Money mission had to put my pistol in a stash
Heard my line beep threw my
Phone in the trash wrap it in plastic
Make it flip like gymnastic
D's is classic make it stretch
That's elastic
All these bands, play with drones
All these bands
Do your top, I recycle all these cans
Trash still booming, two three like reunion
You ain't got no word what
The fuck is you doing
Scary money don't make money that's the topic
Fuck the feds but if it's right I'mma copy it

I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
(yeah)
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
Went and did it
Tricked and flipped it and now
We bought a whip (Woo)
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
I woke up in the morning said I gotta get it
Went and did it
Tricked and flipped it and now
We bought a whip (It's Dax, woo)
