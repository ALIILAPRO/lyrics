		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Morning, today's forecast calls for blue skies)

Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin', everybody's in the play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day? Hey

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly in the city
On the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey 

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration, Mr. Blue Sky's up there waitin'
And today is the day we've waited for

Oh, Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Hey there, Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

(Mr. Blue Sky, Mr. Blue Sky)
(Mr. Blue Sky)

Mr. Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind, I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way

Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (so long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there Mr. Blue (sky)
We're so pleased to be with you (sky)
Look around see what you do (blue)
Everybody smiles at you

(Please turn me over)
