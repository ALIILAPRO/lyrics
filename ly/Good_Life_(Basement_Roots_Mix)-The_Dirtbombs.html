		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more rainy days the sun will chase the clouds away 
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life, good life

Let me take you to a place I know you want to go
It's a good life
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

I wanna stand around and beg you
Just don't say no
No, no, no, no

I have got a feeling that you're gonna like it what I'm doing to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
When I'm doing
What I'm doing I'll be doing what you want me to do
Hey yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 

Love is shining
Life is thriving in the good life
Good life

Good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
In the good life
Good life

No more bad times
Only glad times in the good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
In the good life
Good life

When the groove is rockin' it feels as good as a good life
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah 
I want you to want me
Want the good life all night

No more rainy days
The sun will chase the clouds away
Good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
Good life
In the good life
Good life

No more rainy days the sun will chase the clouds away 
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
Good life, good life
In the good life, good life
