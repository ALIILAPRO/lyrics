		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just hit a 5th of the bottle
And I'm in for it, I'm in for it
You brought your girl and she riding
But I'm in for it, I'm in for it
Call over your homegirls, tell 'em I'm on it
No more excuses, you always do this
I know what I want, I know what I want
No more excuses, no more excuses

Shawty I want, shawty I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want
Shawty I want, shawty I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want

Oh for my nigga gotta get more big game and a lil piece
I need tall money and a lil bitch (Come on)
Kick game on Liu Kang
And my, whip game on Bruce Wayne
I'm coolin' while I'm flickin' a cigar
Tell them bitches by the bar, they can fit up in my car
Shawty wanna kick it with a star
Her friend and m√©nage, she can get it all if she hop in
Riding around town, ten bandos in this Moncler, now they wanna talk
Riding around town in a brand new CLA Mercedes I just bought
Riding around with a stainless new .40 I got it for shawty
Riding around town with lil mama 'cause she know that I got her
As long as you are down, to fuck with a nigga, let's get it
I conquered, I hit it, I did it
You want me, I want you, let's get it, let's get it
I put shit down, fuck with yo nigga, you with it
You with it, I'm with it
Just say that you with it, oh

Just hit a 5th of the bottle
And I'm in for it, I'm in for it
You and your girls in there riding
So I'm in for it, I'm in for it
Call over your homegirls, tell 'em I'm on it
No more excuses, you always do this
I know what I want, I know what I want
No more excuses, no more excuses

Shawty I want, shawty I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want
Shawty I want, shawty I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want

Shootin' nude freaky, you be sending me the pictures on the phone
Hit a nigga late night tellin' me you tryna get it on
Don't waste a nigga time, don't waste a nigga time, we grown
Baby girl, there's a lot of girls, there's a lot of girls in my phone

Call me back when you can
I was just at work and now I just finished
So when you are not busy, just call me
At least before like, I fall asleep

Might drop a 10 in the 4
I'm so offended
I thought that you knew this before
I'm so offended, I'm so offended
I'll come thru on the low
I'm so offended
I'm so offended for thinking that you would've known
How could you have known?
And those diamonds are really bright
I'm on my Goldeneye
I don't wanna talk to you
I might roll the dice
I want a bad bitch now
Need a bad bitch now
She a bad lil one, bad lil one
She's all that I want, she's all that I need
All that I got, checkin' for me
Might drop a 10 in the 4
I'm so offended
I thought that you knew this before
I'm so offended, I'm so offended
