		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roll up all my ones
Take my chances
Hit another blunt
Watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup
I'm dirty dancin'
What am I running from
When I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away

I been shadowboxing your nightmares left and right
Showing up to the battlefield, no one to fight
Keep believing the smoke will clear and the bombs will subside
As I lay down my pride abd
The things I confide in
For all these years
Holding back my tears
Lord knows that I'm trying
I know our love has been dying
I still need you here
I still need you here while I

Roll up all my ones
Take my chances
Hit another blunt
Watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup
I'm dirty dancin'
What am I running from
When I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away

I love shrooms
I might get that tattooed (shit)
Might just keep it cool (yeah)
Depending on my mood (you know how I do)
The sun is rising depending on my moon
Tell them boys back it up
'Cause I'm finna act a fool (gimme some room)

Yabba-daba-doo
I'm with Yebba in my coupe
With my fellas butter soft leathers
Bumping Fela Kuti
Bumping that Gin and Juice
After, after that I left the roof
After that we hit the after hours spot 'til the afternoon
I love shrooms
Verses was hands on
I can't come back with my hands full
Why wait around on the answer
I just air it out like my hamper
Wax like the candle
Back in the days in the bando
(Back in the bando)
'Cause I can't fuck with that ho
'Cause she canceled, with no tampon
Walked with a man without holding her hand
(Holding her hand) period
If I focus I can transform into a lotus
Pull up with Rolls Royces two sisters
Like two twin Holsters ghosted (hocus pocus, magic)

Roll up all my ones
Take my chances
Hit another blunt
Watch the embers burn away
Pour a double cup
I'm dirty dancin'
What am I running from
When I run so
Far away, away, away, away
Far away, away, away, away
