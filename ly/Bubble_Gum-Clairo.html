		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto Bismol veins and I grin

You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?

'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Oh, pink flowers grow from my skin
Oh, Pepto Bismol veins and I grin

Oh
Oh
Oh
