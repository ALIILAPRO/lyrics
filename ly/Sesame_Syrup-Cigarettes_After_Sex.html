		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at your Kate Moss shower curtain
Lying on the bathroom floor naked
Hiding coke inside all your orange Pixy Stix
You take a rail and spread it on your tit

You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

There's a small black notebook that you keep 
Hidden underneath your bed
I've seen before
It says every dirty thing that you did with every single boy
You've ever been with

You've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to you except me
I've had a long list of lovers
But none of them matter to me except you

Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago

And we fall asleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling
And we fall asleep to the scent
Sleep to the scent of long stemmed roses
Always dreaming of sex
Dreaming of sex on the ceiling

Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
Sesame syrup
I heard it a long time ago
