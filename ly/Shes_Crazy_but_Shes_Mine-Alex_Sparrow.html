		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sha la la la
Sha la la la
She's crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la

The kinda girl who really loves to dance
She loves to mess around with her friends
Wanna love her now, wanna love her now
I wanna make her be my girl
Uh

She likes to give a smile to every stranger
She loves to get her ass in any danger
Wanna love her now, wanna love her now (oh)
I wanna make her be my girl

She's crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Singing sha-la-la-la-la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
Sha la la la
Sha la la la (Sha la la la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha la la la)
Uh, she wap she wap
Uh, she wap she wap

She likes to run from troubles in her high heels
She loves McDonald's and she hates Beverly Hills
Wanna love her now, wanna love her now
I wanna wanna make her make her be my girl

Her heartless friends are on the floor (uh-uh)
She loves to dance and fall asleep alone
Wanna love her now, wanna love her now (uh-uh)
I wanna make her be my girl baby

She's crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha la la la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
Sha la la la
Sha la la la
(Sha la la la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind

She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha la la la)
She's crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha la la la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha la la la)
(Sha la la la)
Sha la la la
Sha la la la
(Sha la la la)
Crazy, but she's mine
Damn I lose my mind
She's dancing every night, singing sha-la-la-la-la
(Sha la la la)
