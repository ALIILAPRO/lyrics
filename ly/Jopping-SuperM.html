		  I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right
We gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air
Let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right
시작되는 round

'Cause when we jumping and popping
We jopping

Jopping
Jopping
Jopping

You know how we get down (jopping)
How we get down (jopping)
How we get down 'cause when we jumping and popping
We jopping

Step on the floor (start a riot)
Where the competition man, it's looking one-sided
Up like a seven forty seven, we the flyest
A lifestyle you should try it

So 시작해, make it last
Front to back yeah, yeah (give me that, give me that, give me that)
The roof's on fire, let it burn to an ash
We gon' keep it jopping, tell the DJ bring it back, uh

날아봐 like a para-glide
나타나 in a pair of slides
떠나자 out to paradise
건배해 to a better life

Gotta move, watch the money monsoon
Make the crowd go wild in a small room (yeah)
Let me see you put it all on like a costume
어디까지 번져갈지 몰라

We love to move it, keep it going, don't stop
It's in your nature
말해 girl what you want
춤을 춰봐 We go on and on
Champagne life, that's all you want
Don't stop letting it go 'cause we got that glow

You know how we get down (jopping)
How we get down (jopping)
How we get down 'cause when we jumping and popping
We jopping

I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right
We gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air
Let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right
시작되는 round

'Cause when we jumping and popping
We jopping

Uh, you think ya big boi, throwing three stacks
I'ma show you how to ball, you a mismatch
Opinionated but I'm always spitting straight facts
Throwback, I might throw this on an eight track

믿어봐 I'm a sight to see
Exciting go and drop the beat
We get it jopping the party, it don't stop
축제는 이제부터 시작이니까

이 곳이 파티인데 바삐 어딜 가
We'll keep it jumping and popping here all night
Jump to the front if you want it
Hands up 손을 위로
Don't stop letting it go
Like you don't care

I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage
Left to the right
We gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air
Let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right
시작되는 round

모두 hear that sound (hear that sound)
틀을 벗어난 하나된 신세계를 펼쳐
Play the music loud (music loud)
살아나 'cause tonight's gonna set you free, yeah yeah (yeah)

I don't even care 여긴 우릴 태울 stage (we don't even care)
Left to the right
We gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air
Let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right
시작되는 round

I don't even care 한껏 달아오른 stage
Left to the right
We gon' make it, make it bang
Put your hands in the air
Let me see you bounce
To the left, to the right
시작되는 round

'Cause when we jumping and popping
We jopping
'Cause when we jumping and popping
We jopping
