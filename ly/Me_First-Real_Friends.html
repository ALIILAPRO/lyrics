		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm at best your second option
Like a key under the mat
Are my emotions hard to read?
Seems I'm good at hiding
Reality

You disregard the consequences
Always seem to shift the blame
You burn the bridge and then I build it
Seems you're good at hiding
Reality

Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere

You make me feel helpless
Like a bird with broken wings
Forcing me to be more selfless
Lean on me, don't knock me over
It seems we're good at hiding
It seems we're good at fighting
Reality

Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere

I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
I'm all alone
I'm feeling sorry for you
It's hard to say, there's nothing else I can do
(There's nothing I can do)

Why don't you put me first for once?
And spare me the bad news (Oh no)
Why don't you put me first for once?
We might need to slow down (Oh no)
'Cause I'm not goin' anywhere
