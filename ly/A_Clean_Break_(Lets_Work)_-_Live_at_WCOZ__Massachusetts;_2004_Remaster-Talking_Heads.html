		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just beginning to take that love away
Just beginning to take that love away
In a minute I'll wash that love away
Even now we remember what we used to say
Takes a minute to wash that love away
Take a clean break: wash that love away

Even now we remember what we used to say
Even now we remember what we used to say
We'll be together if we wash that love away

It's a matter
Of degrees
That's true
That's true
It's taken
To extremes
And that's why we
Work so hard to
Take that love away
Take that love away
Take that love away
Take that love away
