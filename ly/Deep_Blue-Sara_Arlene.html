		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We move and curl like the deep blue.
Push and pull your tide.
And tell me which way to go, so
I don't lose my mind, so
I don't lose my mind.
Don't stop even when you're tired.
Stay busy until you're dead.
And keep the clock on your arm, so
You don't lose the time, so
You don't lose the time.
I know a place that's way up high.
It's far above the sea.
A place that you've never been, cuz
We don't need to stay here,
We don't need to stay.
Don't stop even when you're tired.
Stay busy until you're dead.
And keep the clock on your arm, so
You don't lose the time, so
You don't lose the time.
Don't lose my mind.
mmm
mmm
