		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try to discover
A little something to make me sweeter
Oh baby refrain from breaking my heart
I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you gimme no reason
Why you make-a-me work so hard

That you gimme no
That you gimme no
That you gimme no
That you gimme no

Soul, I hear you calling
Oh baby, please, give a little respect to me

And if I should falter
Would you open you arms out to me?
We can make love not war
And live at peace with our hearts
I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
What religion or reason
Could drive a man to forsake his lover?

Don't you tell me no
Don't you tell me no
Don't you tell me no
Don't you tell me no

Soul, I hear you calling
Oh baby, please, give a little respect to me

I'm so in love with you
I'll be forever blue
That you gimme no reason
You know you make-a-me work so hard

That you gimme no
That you gimme no
That you gimme no
That you gimme no

Soul, I hear you calling
Oh baby, please, give a little respect to me

Soul, I hear you calling
Oh baby, please, give a little respect to me
