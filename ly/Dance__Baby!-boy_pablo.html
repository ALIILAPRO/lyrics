		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sitting alone, nobody to hold
The people in here are crazy
Faking a smile now, been here for a while now
I'm fed up with this, I just wanna go home

But damn, that girl
Set me up with her

Dance with me, baby, dance with me, baby
Let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby, dance with me, bae
Under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby, dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl?

I can't understand this, this guy's just a douchebag
I'm so disappointed in myself
The look on her face says, "I hope we go places"
I'm left alone

Should've stayed at home
And searched, "How to date" on Chrome

Dance with me, baby, dance with me, baby
Let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby, dance with me, bae
Under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby, dance with me, baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have that I can't give to you, girl?

I'm sitting alone

Dance with me, baby, dance with me, baby
Let's get lost right here
Dance with me, baby, dance with me, bae
Under the chandelier
Dance with me, baby, dance with me, baby
What does he have that I don't?
I could give the world to you if you turned him down for me
