		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

I got her legs shakin, in the air
Say she feel like she on a elevator
Baby I'm going up like a escalator
I'm gon' fuck your friend she's an instigator
You know I'm getting paper
But wait, but wait
'Member them nights in my Escalade?
Now I'm waking up, bitch, I'm getting paid
PayPal me then it's straight to the Chase (bank)

Let me bust, I won't judge
Let me cuff, like a plaintiff
I'm just playin'
She complainin' T.S.A. I'm on a plane
She think this is all a game
Everybody know my name
I just blew up on the May, I just fucked her best friend
Well, the pussy was good, so well
She won't ever forgive me, oh well
She won't ever forgive me, oh well
Well, the pussy was good, so well
She gon' fuck me better than you, yeah
That shit don't sit witcha well
That shit don't sit witcha well
That shit don't sit witcha well
She gon' fuck me better than you, yeah
That shit don't sit witcha well

I got her legs shakin, in the air
Say she feel like she on a elevator
Baby I'm going up like a escalator
I'm gon' fuck your friend she's an instigator
You know I'm getting paper
But wait, but wait
'Member them nights in my Escalate?
Now I'm waking up, bitch, I'm getting paid
PayPal me then it's straight to the Chase
