		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, that's quite a number to sing
Spotlit, getting lowered in
Can you co-direct and play the twins
And adapt the main theme for mandolins?
I've conjured up wonderful things
The ballad of what could've been
Over and out
It's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band were so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now, the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go

Coordinated release
Nationwide festivities
We had 'em out of their seats
Wavin' their arms and stompin' their feet
Some were just hysterical scenes
The ballad of what could've been
Over and out
Really, it's been a thrill

I had big ideas, the band were so excited
The kind you'd rather not share over the phone
But now, the orchestra's got us all surrounded
And I cannot for the life of me remember how they go

I just can't for the life of me remember how they go
