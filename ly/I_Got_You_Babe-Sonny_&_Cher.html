		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say we're young and we don't know
We won't find out until we grow
Well, I don't know if all that's true
'Cause you got me, and baby, I got you

Babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned, our money's all been spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a plot
But at least I'm sure of all the things we got

Babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're a clown
And if I get scared, you're always around

Don't let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb

Babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you, I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you, babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe
I got you, babe
