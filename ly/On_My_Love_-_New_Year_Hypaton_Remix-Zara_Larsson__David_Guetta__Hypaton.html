		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (That's on my love)
(That's on my love)

Now I don't need the time to make up my mind (yeah, yeah)
That's on my love (yeah)
That's on my love (yeah), yeah
Hear my pain, can you hear my prayer?
Take my breath, can you take me there? (Yeah)
That's on my love, yeah, yeah

Into the dark, into the light, baby, I go
Whether it's wrong, whether it's right, I will follow
I'll pay the price, I'll sacrifice
That's on my love, yeah

On my love, on my love
I put that on my, on my love, on my love
I put that on my love
I put that on my love
On my love, on my love
I put that on my, on my love, on my love
I put that on my love
I put that on my love

That's on my love
That's on my love

I still need you deep in my heart (yeah, yeah)
That's on my love (yeah)
That's on my love (yeah), yeah
You're the one thing I can't escape
You're the fire to my warm embrace, yeah
That's on my love

Into the dark, into the light, baby, I go
Whether it's wrong, whether it's right, I will follow
I'll pay the price, I'll sacrifice
That's on my love, yeah

On my love, on my love
I put that on my, on my love, on my love
I put that on my love (I put that on my love)
I put that on my love (I put that on my love)
On my love, on my love
I put that on my, on my love, on my love
I put that on my love (my love)
I put that on my love (I put that on my love)

That's on my love
That's on my love
I put that on my love
I put that on my love

On my love, on my love
I put that on my, on my love, on my love
I put that on my love (my love)
I put that on my love (I put that on my love)
