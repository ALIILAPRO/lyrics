		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah (mh)
Peepin' out the window (peepin' out the window)
Peepin' out the window (peepin' out the window)

Peepin' out the window, yeah (yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead
Wanna smoke me like I'm indo, oh
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin'
I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely, bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dawgs bossed up

I doubled up, I don't do no chores no more
I ain't steppin' on these niggas like no rugs no more
Find myself carin' way too much, ain't got no shrubs no more
But got way bigger shows
I ain't chargin' dubs no more
I charge a half a million dollars just to walk out
I hate the police, but I'm big, so they brought cops out
I got a gun, shoots sixteen times, but it's fun sized
Sign on the dotted lines
One time for the ones saw me come from nothin'
Speakin' of nothin'
pussy niggas know not to play, I ain't goin' for nothin' (yeah)

Peepin' out the window (yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead
Wanna smoke me like I'm indo, oh
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin'
I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely, bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dawgs bossed up

Youngin' jumped inside the game, he got some fuckin' diamonds
We make temporary decisions, change the fuckin' climate
Run with D-boys, yeah, them boys who be runnin' the lobby
Change the channel, you know I'm up next by the way I'm poppin'
I sip on syrup a lot but no one understand me
I told my mama, "No more sufferin', I made it"
You should've seen all these motherfucker faces
I told my brother them, "We ain't goin' back to basics"
Ever since I copped the Hellcat
Niggas still wonderin' why like, "BSlime, you did that?"
I'm kickin' my ones and two, chillin' at the rib shack
Wishin' I can bring my dawg from the fuckin' jailmates

Peepin' out the window, yeah (yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead
Wanna smoke me like I'm indo, oh
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin'
I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely, bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dawgs bossed up

Peepin' out the window
All I see is a bunch of racist-ass cops 
Tryna catch a nigga slackin' like Jim Crow
Had to make it through the worst on the turf, out the dirt
Niggas stayin' down, ten toes
I done seen a lot of struggle that came with this game
She cried, bitch gon' lie just to fuck on my chain
I drunk codeine and pop one just to stimulate my brain

Peepin' out the window (yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead
Wanna smoke me like I'm indo, oh
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin'
I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely, bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dawgs bossed up
Hell yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peepin' out the window, yeah, yeah
See the opps risin' from the dead when I look out my window
All this water in these baguettes, we might turn into Nemo, yeah
