		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You chain me up, still speculating
Never enough but soon
You'll see I'm unrestrainable
I'm uncontainable
Any moment,  I'll have you begging
Don't turn your back
Oh, can't you see that I'm untamable?
I'm unmistakable

I'm hearing it all, I hear it in my head
Whispering, they're whispering again
Hearing it all, they see me as a threat
Pushing me, keep pushing to the edge

You keep calling me a psycho
Got it in my head, careful what you say
Think you might be right though
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You keep calling me a psycho
Thought that I was scared but I came prepared
Think you might be right though
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You made me a psycho, a psycho

You won't stop me, don't bother trying
Never enough 'cause soon
You'll see I'm unrestrainable
I'm uncontainable
I always search for light in darkness
You'll never think I'm weak
'cause I'm untamable i'm unmistakable

I'm hearing it all, I hear it in my head
Whispering, they're whispering again
Hearing it all, they see me as a threat
Pushing me, keep pushing to the edge

You keep calling me a psycho
Got it in my head, careful what you say
Think you might be right though
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You keep calling me a psycho
Thought that I was scared but I came prepared
Think you might be right though
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You made me a psycho, a psycho

I'm hearing it all, I hear it in my head
Whispering, they're whispering again
Hearing it all, they see me as a threat
Pushing me, keep pushing to the edge

You keep calling me a psycho
Got it in my head, careful what you say
Think you might be right though
You made me a psycho, a psycho
You keep calling me a psycho
Thought that I was scared but I came prepared
Think you might be right though
You made me a psycho, a psycho
