		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want love (I don't want love)
If love isn't from you (If love isn't from you)
I don't want her (I don't want her)
If she isn't you (If she isn't you)
You're always on my mind
That's how much I care
I can't think of a time
That you weren't there
I know that I'd be lying if I
Didn't want you here
Cause baby I'm in love
And why can't you just live near
Ngano layo kay ka
Wala tay mabuhat
Kung diri ka sa akong tupad
Adto tag cinema
Human mangaon ta
Kaon bisag asa
Ikay pili
Akoy bayad
Ako ray bahala
Ako ray bahala
Why do you live so far (Why do you live so far)
Sayang kung LDR (Sayang kung LDR)
Cause I know what happens to them
They always fall apart
But now you've changed my mind (But now you've changed my mind)
Cause you're the girl I want in life (Cause you're the girl I want in life)
I want you to have my heart
You're mine and I am yours
I don't want love (I don't want love)
If love isn't from you (If love isn't from you)
I don't want her (I don't want her)
If she isn't you (If she isn't you)
You're always on my mind
That's how much I care
I can't think of a time
That you weren't there
I know that I'd be lying if I
Didn't want you here
Cause baby I'm in love
And why can't you just live near
You're always on my mind
That's how much I care
I can't think of a time
That you weren't there
I know that I'd be lying if I
Didn't want you here
Cause baby I'm in love
And why can't you just live near
But now you've changed my mind
Cause you're are the girl I want in life
I want you to have my heart
You're mine and I am yours
