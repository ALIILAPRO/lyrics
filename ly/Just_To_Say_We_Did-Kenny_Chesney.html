		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drove from Knoxville to Myrtle Beach
Seven buddies in an old RV
Beer cooler and no AC
Just to say we did
That night we climbed up Chimney Rock
Knowin' it was a real long drop
Three, two, one, we jumped off
Just to say we did

Never had no rhyme or reason why
It just seemed like the thing to do at the time

Just to say we did
Just to feel alive
To take a leap of faith
To feel that kind of high
Tonight let's turn it up
Fall in love a while then catch enough buzz
To just ride them crazy horses
Runnin' through our heads
Just to say we did

She said, "I'd never seen the Vegas lights
Spun the wheel or roll the dice"
We doubled down on crazy night
Just to say we did

We didn't have no rhyme or reason why
It just seemed like the thing to do at the time

Just to say we did
Just to feel alive
To take a leap of faith
To feel that kind of high
Tonight let's turn it up
Fall in love a while then catch enough buzz
To just ride them crazy horses
Runnin' through our heads
Just to say we did
Just to say we did

So let's raise our hands up to the sky
Stay on this roller coaster ride

Just to say we did
Just to feel alive
Let's take a leap of faith
To feel that kind of high
Tonight let's turn it up
Fall in love a while then catch enough buzz
To just ride them crazy horses
Runnin' through our heads
Just to say we did
Just to say we did
Just to say we did
