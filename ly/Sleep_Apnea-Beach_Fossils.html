		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pardon me
I didn't realize
What's in your eyes
My arms are open wide
But I can't ever decide
What I wanna do

I'm starin' at the sky
But I can't tell which way
My thoughts are traveling
I'm tryna listen to your words
But I can't feel my head
And it's unraveling

Sometimes I no longer know
What it means to care about
The things you wanna do
Everybody's living or they're dead
And I'm still in my bed
And I don't have a clue

I won't lie
And tell you it's alright
I won't lie
And tell you it's alright
