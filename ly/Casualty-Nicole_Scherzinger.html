		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too close to see so much of love we stop breathing
Sweet history ain't enough to keep my heart beating
So many tips for you I sacrificed
Too many lies for you I justified
How can you stand there sayin' you know who's to blame
How can you verify everything is OK

Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, no
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And then tell we're not dyin'
One of us has gonna be
A one of us has gonna be
A casualty

It's cold in here
And my heart's to want you to hold me
Baby you never hear
But when you with me I can say it now

I see you talking but your lips don't lipsynch
You see me crying but my tears don't hurt you now
How can you stand there sayin' you know who's to blame
How can you verify everything is OK

Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, no
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And then tell we're not dyin'
One of us has gonna to be
A one of us has gonna be
A casualty

Breathe in Breathe out
Baby without to fit that over and over again
I stand there to as you call but then I'd fall over and over again

Don't tell me you love me
Then put a gun to my head
And say I'm not trying, no
Don't tell me you want me
Then come to my bed
And then tell we're not dyin'
One of us has gonna to be
A one of us has gonna be
A casualty

One of us has gonna to be
A one of us has gonna be
A casualty
