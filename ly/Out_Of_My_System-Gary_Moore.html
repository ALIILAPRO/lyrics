		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're out of reach, you're out of touch.
This time baby you've run out of love.
You're out of sight, you're out of mind.
Another heartache I've left behind.

It doesn't make any difference
where you go from here.
Too many times you've been running
I was here, over and over again.

Well, I've got you out of my system.
I've got you out of my soul.

We've been through this a thousand times.
Too many partners for your perfect crimes.
You turned your back when I was down.
Well, this time baby I won't be around.

It doesn't make any difference
what you do or say.
This time it's over forever.
I'm on my way,
don't wanna see you again.

Well, I've got you out of my system.
I've got you out of my soul.
Well, I've got you out of my system.
And now I'm right outside your control.

It doesn't make any difference
where you go from here.
Too many times you've been running
I was here, over and over again.

Well, I've got you out of my system.
I've got you out of my soul.
Well, I've got you out of my system, out of my system.
And now I'm right outside your control.
I've got you out of my system.

Well, I've got you out of my system.
Out of my system.
I've got you out of my soul.
Out of my soul.

Well, I've got you out of my system.
Out of my system.
And now I'm right outside your control.
