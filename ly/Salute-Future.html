		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This for my young nigga grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in them Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dirty, my nigga, let's twist up some dirty
This for my young nigga grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

I see your loyalty payin' off
I see your grind been payin' off
I see the dope, been payin' off
I see the plug, been payin' off
I went to work, they was layin' off
Lil' shawty be popping them Xans out
Lil mama she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now

I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me
I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me
Bitches can't hold me
I'm juiced up with shorty
I'm whipping the 'Rari
Or the new Maserati
Bust a jugg in the West End at the parking lot
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot
Styrofoam cups, all I know is I get crazy, man
My partners on dust, they gon shoot up a whole stadium
I don't trust your baby mama but we made a crazy film
And I smashed her last night on a lot of pills
And we turned her apartment to a trap house deal
And I turned her apartment to my dope house deal

I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in them Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dirty, my nigga, let's twist up some dirty
This for my young nigga grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie

When I jumped out the porch, I was selling that crack like that shit was a sport
I was running through bushes, jumping over fences, I gotta get away from them narcs
Hey, man I can never get away from this art
They treat you like Lord, they treat you like God when you beat the odds
None of my dreams was reality just a few years ago, homie was starving
Just a few years ago, homie was starving
Bust a jugg in the West End at the parking lot
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot

I see your loyalty payin' off
I see your grindin' payin' off
I see the dope, been payin' off
I see the plug, been payin' off
I went to work, they were layin' off
Lil' shawty be popping them Xans on it
Lil mama she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now
