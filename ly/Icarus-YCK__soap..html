		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah you know what it is so be stepping aside
I haven't really gave a fuck if I be dead or alive
So bite the bullet trigger pulling seek the end or beginning
Depends on how you're looking at it until then I'll be sinning
Descended in the portal no more juice in the flask
No use depending on the mortals ain't the easiest task
I'm overzealous I'm heretical meeting an archangel
Viewing it from the heavens the humans that aren't grateful
Taking the filth that we're cleansing blood in we bathe I'm popping a benzo
Ridding myself of depression by taking my place inside of a deadzone
Need no coffin burials to soak the debris
These ceremonial rituals practiced down to a T
Lost track of the demons out of Pandora's Box
Road into redemption coming after or not
I got the chains up on my flesh I'm in a liminal space
To rip the veins up out my chest look how we've fallen from grace

Empty the heavens the flooding'll sink ships
Rain down the red and we covet the wings clipped
Flew close to the sun how the tales do tell
When we angered the gods with no lives to sell

Okay I'm taking the face from you when i walk in the room
Ain't never debating, it ain't on you why you act like a tool
I broke the data bank and it showing where you log in and move
IP address and now I'm next them existential ensue
And if I said it's soon know I ain't waiting for nothing
I been evading the public cause I ain't faking
And fuck it
It's all in my DNA there's something keeping me from reduction
It doesn't appeal to me the sucking up to deal with the funding
Won't ever front for buck and won't ever run for a bill
I'm at the front of the shuttle punching the blunt and a shill
Evacuate em out the way I'm an
Immaculate mill
I Turn em up into the dust when they in front of us, still
I don't know what the fuck assumption that you held in your head
But really the fact is I ain't running from nobody or dread
I face it every single morning when I wake in this mess
And I been breaking it's rebuttal since I frame my distress
Yuh

Empty the heavens the flooding'll sink ships
Rain down the red and we covet the wings clipped
Flew close to the sun how the tales do tell
When we angered the gods with no lives to sell
