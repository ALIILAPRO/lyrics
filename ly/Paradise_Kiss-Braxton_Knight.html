		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ‏‏‎[‎Intro]
‏‏‎You seem like you're doing real well
I take it things are good with Arashi
Don't look at me like that, it's been about two years now
I got over it a long time ago
If you still don't want to see me, though, I understand (Woaahhh)
And I'll do my best to respect that (Woaahhh)
But, if it's not too much trouble (‎Woaahhh)
It'd be nice if you could drop by my folks' joint with Arashi once in awhile
My mom and dad miss you guys (‎Woaahhh)

[Chorus]
Shawty wanna spend the night out (night out)
I said, I just might catch you later no doubt
Hop up in my Tesla, I'm in route
Leave her shocked like Zatch Bell, her lights out

Shawty wanna spend the night out (night out)
I said, I just might catch you later no doubt
Hop up in my Tesla, I'm in route
Leave her shocked like Zatch Bell, her lights out

[Verse]
In the club, let's just run it up
By the way she talkin’ I think shawty fell in love
Is she really plotting, or just falling for the drugs
If I'm wrong I’ll say I'm sorry
My true thoughts are so unjust

No trust, like Arashi
I can't tell I hurt your soul, just like Yukari
Why the hell I messed things up before it started
Switching up the setting real fast, let's just dead this party

All your haunting pain, take it all away
From your eyes okay, tonight!
Let’s be on our way, to a sacred place
This will be our paradise
Way beyond the planes, where the angels play
That where shorty came, no lie
Every night I pray, that you have to stay
'Cause you are my only light

[Outro]
What's going on? Why are you ignoring me?
Can't really say, perhaps it's 'cause I'm jealous
What?
Would you mind giving me some space, I'm feeling very rooted right now
