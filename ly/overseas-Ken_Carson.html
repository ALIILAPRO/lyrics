		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  London, Paris, Amsterdam, yeah, I'm overseas
She gon' suck my soul out me, yeah, she on her knees
Inhale, exhale, yeah, breathe
Twelve asked me, "What's that smell? ", Yeah, weed
I ain't leavin' no paper trail, yeah, this shit free
Overlap them niggas, hell yeah, I'm in the lead
You ain't act like me, you don't bleed what I bleed
Put the blick down, I'll beat your ass just like Creed

She don't know nothin' 'bout me, I'm 'bout to turn her to a freak
My dick her Nyquil, I'm 'bout to fuck this bitch to sleep
I'm the reason you got double B on your feet
Ain't gotta ask if I'm good, I'm Gucci, yeah, I'm double G
I wish I could go back in time to tell myself, "Your neck gon' freeze"
I wish I could go back in time to tell myself, "Don't change a thing"
I wish I could go back in time to meet you right before I did
I wish I could go back in time to tell myself, "You gon' be rich"
When I'm in Miami, I feel like LeBron, number six
Every day I wake up, I'm feelin' myself like Bey' and Nicki
I just bit her, yeah, I just bit her, I gave her a hit
I take her shoppin' out of town, but that's my girl so I ain't trick
I'm in London, I just left Harrods and Selfridges
That boy repeat everything he hear like a parrot, he a bitch
The last bitch I broke up with slit her wrist
I'm trollin', I just treat her like she no longer exists

London, Paris, Amsterdam, yeah, I'm overseas
She gon' suck my soul out me, yeah, she on her knees
Inhale, exhale, yeah, breathe
Twelve asked me, "What's that smell? ", Yeah, weed
I ain't leavin' no paper trail, yeah, this shit free
Overlap them niggas, hell yeah, I'm in the lead
You ain't act like me, you don't bleed what I bleed
Put the blick down, I'll beat your ass just like Creed
