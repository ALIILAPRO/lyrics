		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mother, mother
There's too many of you crying
And brother, brother, brother
There's too many of you dying
You know you've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Father, father we don't need to escalate
You know, war is not the answer
Only love can conquer hate
You know you've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
C'mon, talk to me, so you can see
What's going on what's going on
What's going on what's going on

Father, father everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long
You know you've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today

Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
C'mon talk to me so you can see
What's going on what's going on
What's going on what's going on
