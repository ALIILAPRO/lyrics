		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't believe a word, I know you tell me lies
Just watch me flip the bird, right in your lyin' eyes
You just can't figure out, why I'm the way I am
I'm low-life born and bred, and I don't give a damn

[Chorus:]
I've had enough, I'm stepping out of line
Ain't gonna stop me babe, you ain't worth a dime
You nearly had me fooled, wastin' my time
You might've broke my heart
And if you broke my heart
I know it ain't my crime

I'm here to tell you, was here and now I'm gone
You need a wages slave, but I sure ain't the one
I'm moving off the lot, just hire another act
I don't need what you got, that ain't where I'm at

[Chorus]

Just show me the door, here I go again
I seen it all before, happens now and then
No tears in your eyes, sure ain't none in mine
Two people in disguise, frozen in time
