		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't never see them
They never see them (ow)
And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good and swim good, good

Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated (yeah)
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference (no, no)
If I feel like a Ghost (no Swayze) ever since I lost my baby?
I've had this black suit on (ow)
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral (ow)
One more mile 'til the road runs out, out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes and swim good and swim good
Take off this suit and swim good and swim good, good

I'm going off (oh my pretty love), don't try stopping me
I'm going off (throw me a line), don't try saving (oh my)
No flares (oh my), no vest (but you're my love), and no fear
Waves are washing me (out)

I'm about to drive (drive) in the ocean (ocean, yeah)
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me (bigger than me)
Kick off my shoes (good) and swim good (good), and swim good
Take off this suit (take off this suit)
And swim good, and swim good, good
