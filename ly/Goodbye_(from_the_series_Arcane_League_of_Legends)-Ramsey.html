		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear the sound of a heartbeat before it goes out
Won't ever leave my memory of bloodshed all around
And I can see a tear on my father's face before it falls out
Oh, my enemy, how could I have ever let you down? Oh

When all these trees saw us grow
Cut our teeth and make our bones right here
We'd play with shields made of stone
Share our dreams and sit our thrones
Be still, 'cause I see smoke up ahead and I got steel in my hands
We will return like warriors, I swear, that we'll find glory up ahead
Tell me

Where is my home?
I don't recognize the faces anymore, no
Where is my friend?
The one I've known since I was only just a kid

I think it's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

Is it time to say goodbye?
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

It's time to say goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, woah

Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm, mm
