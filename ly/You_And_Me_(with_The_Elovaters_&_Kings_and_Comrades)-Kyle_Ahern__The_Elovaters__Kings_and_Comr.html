		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinking bout you and me, under the trees
With the stars up above and I can't get enough
Take a lift tonight, vibe so right
Won't you stay with me

We can cruise to the sea darling, you and me
Waves breaking on the shore, couldn't ask for more
Wash your worries away, gonna live for the day
This is all I need

Taking it easy, spreadin positvity
Taking it easy, darling just you and me


It's so easy, easy, easy to love you
It's so easy, easy, just you and me
It's so easy, easy, easy to love you
It's so easy, easy, it's all I need
Just you and me

I can still remember in the summer
When I saw you bumping music
ct the party one night

Everyone was vibin and the feeling was electric
When I saw you looking into my eye
Give me that realness in the feeling 
If you want it
Don't wanna waste my time
Make it easy, or im gone
Lovin is easy as the breeze if you feel it
Lovin the energy and the feeling of your spirit

Thinking bout you and me
Underneath the trees with the stars up above
That would be enough
Tellin them all we really need is good lovin
cll we really need is good lovin 


Taking it easy, (Easy)
Spreadin positvity (Positive)
Taking it easy, darling just you and me


It's so easy, easy, easy to love you
It's so easy, easy, just you and me
It's so easy, easy, easy to love you
It's so easy, easy, it's all I need
Just you and me
