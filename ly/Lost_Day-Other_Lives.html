		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on exit aisle, no, you won't see me this time
I'm in and out of love but you know I couldn't find it
I'm gonna let you go, now you won't see me around
See, I'd want it then, I don't want it now

Oh, it's the last amen for the newborn seeker
See, I'm a natural kind and you won't find what you like
No, it's the last amen for the newborn seeker

Let me know you're real
Let me know you're real

I don't mess around, no, you won't see me in time
It's a death defying act you won't believe

Oh, it's the last amen for the newborn seeker

Let me know you're real
Let me know you're real

Oh, it's the last amen for the newborn seeker
Oh, it's the last amen for the newborn seeker
