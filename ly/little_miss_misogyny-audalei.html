		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say women aren't funny
But you laugh at his bad jokes
Hate on girls who wear makeup
Cause it's just a shallow hoax
Say ladies are the drama
And too complicated
Love your boys
But hate the ones they dated

You're not a girl's girl
It's clear to me
Cater to his world

And I don't hate you I just wish you weren't

Little Miss Misogyny
Hyped up on hypocrisy
Living in a dichotomy
Little Miss Misogyny

You told him what's more basic
Than drinking Starbucks
What does basic even mean
It's just a Grande cup

You said he's not a bad guy but
He's the worst I've ever seen
You said "boys will be boys" but
She was only seventeen

You're not a girl's girl
It's clear to me
Cater to his world
But at what fee

You're not a girl's girl
It's clear to me
Cater to his world

And I don't hate you I just wish you weren't

Little Miss Misogyny
Hyped up on hypocrisy
Living in a dichotomy
Little Miss Misogyny

I get it- I fall victim too
Brush things off and play it cool
It's not a crazy thing to do
But competition is insane

I get it-I'm aware 
of the way they speak the way they stare
The system's not set up by you
But I don't even wanna play

Little Miss Misogyny
Hyped up on hypocrisy
Living in a dichotomy
Little Miss Misogyny
