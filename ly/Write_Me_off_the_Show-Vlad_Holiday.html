		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think it’s time you write me off the show
I’ll sing one more song before I go
Take you to that place that only 
You and I used to know

I think I might just breathe a little more
Stare up at the beauty from below
Let go of all the things I’ve never known
It’s too late to begin again
I guess I tried the best I could

But was it good enough for you?
For you
Nothing would have mattered without you
You,
Was I good enough?
