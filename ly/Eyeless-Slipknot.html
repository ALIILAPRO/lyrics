		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Insane am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain
How many times have you wanted to kill
Everything and everyone
Say you'll do it but never will

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

I am my father's son
'Cause he's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me nothing
How many times have you wanted to die?
It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head, yeah

I tried you lied to me for so long
Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
Freak on my antics and give me a choice
Doesn't matter if I give a shit
It's shit that you gave me

You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

It's all in your head
It's all in my head
It's all in your head

Do you wanna feel pain? Takin' my name in vain
Caring never felt so lame inside
Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
Maybe I'll reverse my ride
Who the fuck are you? Fuck you
Better suck it up 'cause you bled through
Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me

I feel safe
Seems you're saved
I feel safe
It seems you're saved

Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Motherfucker

Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new eye
Look me in my brand new
