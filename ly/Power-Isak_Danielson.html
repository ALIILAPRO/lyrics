		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still look at you with eyes that want you
When you move, you make my oceans move too 

If I hear my name, I will run your way 

Can we say that we love each other 
Can we play like there ain't no other 

if I hear my name, I will run your way 

It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need

You got power, you got power
You got power over me

I give my all now, can't you see
Why won't you set me free?

You got power, you got power
You got power over me

I was lost until I found me in you
I saw a side of me that I was scared to 

But now I hear my name and I'm running your way

All I feel as I get closer to you
Is the desire to move like you do

So now I hear my name and I'm running your way

I am ready now

It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need

You got power, you got power
You got power over me

I give my all now, can't you see
Why won't you set me free?

You got power, you got power
You got power over me 

You're the one that seduced me, lured me in with your beauty
Now I know that you used me, all you did was confuse me
You're no longer what I need, touch me slow, feel my heart bleed
