		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your mouth floats above my bed at night
My own private moon

Just because the mind can make up whatever it wants
Doesn't mean that it'll never come true
Whatever happened? (Just because she can)
Please, could I change that?

Is that the right thing to do?
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know
Is that the right thing to do?
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know

Let me introduce one to the other
The dream and the real
Get them acquainted
Just because she can introduce
Just because she can
A mouth to a mouth

Is that the right thing to do?
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know
Is that the right thing to do?
Oh, I just don't know, I just don't know

Can I just sneak up from behind?
To the back of his head
Then I lift up his hair
And live forever so lightly
That's where her hair starts

Just because she can
Now please can I kiss him?
Just because she can
Yo quiero besarle
Just because she can
Come on, please, can I kiss him?
Just because she can
I just don't know, oh

Just because she can (can)
There's a line there, I can't cross it
Just because she can
There's a line there, I can't cross it (come)
Just because she can
There's a line there, I can't cross it
Just because she can
There's a line there, I can't cross it

There's a line there, I can't cross it
There's a line there, I can't cross it
There's a line there, I can't cross it
There's a line there, I can't cross it
