		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, brother, what you thinking?
Leave that old record spinning
You feel the rhythm, going
(They call it lonely digging)
Let's end your time to lay low
Your knees a-bending, so
It's time to get up and let go
(You're gonna come undone)

Hey, mama, how's it going?
Can't see your body moving
Don't leave the party dying
(They call it lonely digging)
Your booty shaking, you know
Your head has no right to say no
Tonight it's ready, set, go

Baby can you move it round the rhythm
So we can get with 'em
To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene

Hey, brother, what you thinking?
That good ol' sound is ringing
They don't know what they're missing
(They call it lonely digging)
Let's end your time to lay low
Your knees a-bending, so
It's time to get up and let go

Hey, brother, nice and steady
Put down your drink, you ready
It's hard when things get messy
(They call it lonely digging)
Your booty shaking, you know
Your head has no right to say no
Tonight it's ready, set, go

Baby can you move it round the rhythm
So we can get with 'em
To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene

Baby can you move it round the rhythm
So we can get with 'em
To the ground and get us a rock and roll round
Just a downtown body body coming with a super-hottie
Let's go, yes, no, hell no
Baby can you move it round the rhythm
'Cause you know we're living in the fast lane, speed up
It ain't no game, just turn up all the beams when I come up on the scene
