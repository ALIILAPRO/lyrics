		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come over
Sweet talkin' in the right ways
Come over
Day trippin' on a night wave
I'll show ya
How to fuck with a good thing
'Cause you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are

The fire in my feet
The red sun that's comin' down
The bitter, the sweet
Tearing me inside-out
I don't wanna leave
But, I've been here before
Every time I
Walk this line

'Cause love don't
Love don't love me
But, I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up
No, love don't
Love don't come free
But, I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up

(I don't wanna give it up)

Hungover
In the morning I'll be long gone
'Cause it's over
Flying sky high with a new guy
I told ya
That I'd fuck up a good time
'Cause you are, you are
You are, you are, you are, you are

The fire in my feet
The red sun that's comin' down
The bitter, the sweet
Tearing me inside-out
I don't wanna leave
But, I've been here before
Every time I
Walk this line

'Cause love don't
Love don't love me
But, I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up
No, love don't
Love don't come free
But, I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up

I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up

(I don't wanna give it up)

'Cause love don't
Love don't love me
But, I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up
No, love don't
Love don't, for free
But, I don't wanna give it up
I don't wanna give it up

I don't wanna give it up

Love don't, love don't
Love don't, love don't
Love don't love me
I don't wanna give it up
