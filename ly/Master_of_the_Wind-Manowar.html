		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside your dreams calling to your spirit
As the sail calls the wind, here the angels sing.
Far behind the sun, across the western sky
Reach to the blackness, find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
Will carry all our dreams on a single beam of light.

Close your eyes, look into the dreams
Winds of changes will winds of fortune bring.

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find.
There the road begins where another one will end,
Here the for winds know who will brake and who will bend
All to be the Master of the wind.

Falling stars now light my way my life has written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below, high ascend between the spirit
When the wind fills the sky and clouds will move aside,
There will be a road to all our dreams and for every day that stings
Two better days it brings, nothing is as bad as it seems.

Close your eyes, look into the dreams
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring.

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky
Gold is at the end for each of us to find.
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the for winds know who will brake and who will bend
All to be the Master of the wind.
