		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity

When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went
To hold me
To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry, it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me
I thought, "Must be lonely lovin' someone
Tryin' to find their way out of a maze"
Oh, I know

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
