		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a resident evil attack
Zombie take over, boy watch your back
Infected disease, unprotected
Soul catcher, listen, everybody dress black
Goods vs evil, evil vs worse
Words vs Taliban, words vs curse
Don't fuck with we, somebody wanna fuck with we
A richy richy bombs gang

No retreating, no surrender
Mash the man with the heavyweight sound

Boy stop top, you musta head fuck
Everything you ever said you know it is a lie
We're not listening to bullshit, no
Your breath stinks like bati old, so go
Move on the way we tell ya, once before
So rude boy, fooled boy, move from me dollar
Don't fuck with we
Rude boy don't wanna fuck with we, a richy richy bombs gang

We running it, gunning it
You know you can't kill the power
Skilling it, killing it
You know you can't kill the power
You keep on running but you just can't hide
Kill the power
You keep on running but you know you can't hide
Can't kill the power

Ain't no killing what cannot be killed
I'm not joking, the blood gets spilled
Rewind, select, I bomb shacka lick
Idiot salt boy, suck my dick
Drop down, roll on, good bye, so long
Ain't no killing what cannot be killed
On the ground you're gonna stay long
That's the way cemetery gets filled

No retreat and no surrender
Mash the man with the heavyweight sound

We running it, gunning it
You know you can't kill the power
Skilling it, killing it
You know you can't kill the power
You keep on running but you just can't hide, kill the power
You keep on running but you know you can't hide, can't kill the power

Beat drums, beat the drums...

We won't surrender
We won't give up, no we not give up
We won't surrender
We won't give up, no we not give up
No we'll never give up
No we won't give up

You keep on running but you just can't hide, kill the power
You keep on running but you know you can't hide, kill the power
We running it, gunning it
You know you can't kill the power
Skilling it, killing it
You know you can't kill the power

Kill the power (kill the power)

Beat drums, beat the drums...
