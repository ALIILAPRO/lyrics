		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear that death sound, baby,
Oh, like an echo in my brain.
I hear that death sound, baby,
Oh, like an echo in my brain.
Well, there's a part of us dying,
You know things will never be the same,
Ah, never be the same!

I feel the black nails a-poundin' now,
Yes, into the coffin of our love.
Hear the black nails a-poundin' now,
Yes, into the coffin of our love.
Well, like a black shrouded hunter now,
Don't you know that I have killed a snow-white dove,
Oh, I've killed a dove!

Well, the time sands keep a-fallin' now
On toward our ending day.
Yeah, the time sands keep a-fallin'
Towards our ending day.
I see the minutes chasing the hours, Yes, to the words that we should say,
Ah, we should say!
