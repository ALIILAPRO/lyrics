Now this shit got big, this shit got bigger than ever (ooh)
I just hopped the jet, this shit go straight to L.A (shit go straight)
Bitch, I done got rich, I done got richer than ever (yeah)
Now, I got these whips, these whips bigger than ever (skrrt)
Huh, I been blockin' shade, I sit under umbrellas 
I'm a alien, bitch, I feel like changin' the weather
I don't even talk to nobody, no bitch, but it's smooth like butter
I been chillin' out, lil' bitch, but I'm high as them devils 
We so mad, like devils in our head 
I'm on demand, every time I drop, I am (we so mad)
Ha, we so mad, them devils call me "Him" (yeah)
They call me God, 'cause I'm as high as Him (high as Him)
I remember back, when I was fuckin' broke (yeah)
Now I'm chillin' out in south of France on a boat (yeah)
I could make the money come, I can make it go
Yeah, I don't need to fly, I just need to flow (I-I-I-I)
Ha, I don't even laugh, y'all already jokes (yeah)
All my money flip, all my money bloats (yeah)
All my diamonds shine, all my diamonds moats (yeah)
I might have to go lose control

I got diamonds on my yacht, and I got diamonds on my bitch (yeah, what?)
I could put money on your heads, I could put money on your kids (yeah)
I call the mob and they come kill 'em, that's as easy as it gets, yeah, yeah
I'm done layin' back, plottin', I'm, droppin' everythin', I'm droppin' all these hits, yeah, yeah
It take a lot of motherfuckin' money just to get here, and look like this (yeah)
I had to shit on them constantly, so they could look at me and fear for they life (ha-ha-ha, yeah)
Way back when them thoughts was easy
Now shit get sleazy and it get peezy, yeah
I rock APeezy it get fleezy (yeah)
My diamonds 3D, their not CGI
I can get you dead, I can you get fried (yeah)
I can kill you with no eyes open
They could cut out one of my eyes
Why? Every time I look back, they surprised

Now this shit got big, this shit got bigger than ever (ooh)
I just hopped the jet, this shit go straight to L.A (shit go straight)
Bitch, I done got rich, I done got richer than ever (yeah)
Now, I got these whips, these whips bigger than ever (skrrt)
Huh, I been blockin' shade, I sit under umbrellas (ooh)
I'm a alien, bitch, I feel like changin' the weather
I don't even talk to nobody, no bitch, but it's smooth like butter
I been chillin' out, lil' bitch, but I'm high as them devils (ooh)
We so mad, like devils in our head (I'm so high)
I'm on demand, every time I drop, I am (we so mad)
