		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been a roaming Romeo
My Juliets have been many
But now my roaming days have gone
Too many irons in the fire
Is worse than not having any
I've had my share and from now on

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you
 
I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through
 
I've got a great big amount
Saved up in my love account
Honey
And I've decided
Love divided
In two
Won't do
 
So
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you

I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you
 
I'm giving all my love to one baby
Heaven help me if my baby don't come through
 
I've tried to love more than one
Finding it just can't be done
Honey
There's one I lie to
When I try to
Be true
To two
 
So
I'm putting all my eggs in one basket
I'm betting everything I've got on you
