		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I have tears cloudin' up my eyes
Comes out of nowhere, middle of a conversation
Waitin' for it and not a clear sky (clear sky)
I'm underwater

Wonder if it's all because of you
I got close to givin' up
Somehow it's all because of you
It's funny when it comes to us
Ooh

Whenever you're cold, I'm shiverin'
Whenever you're stoned, I'm hoverin'
It's like whenever you're gone, I'm losin' it
But baby, I'll go where you go
Whenever you fall, I'll fall behind
Whenever you're stuck, I see red lights
It's like whenever you're gone, I'm not alright
'Cause baby, I'll go where you go
I'll go where you go

I can't get out of bed in the morning now, if you don't, ah, ah, mm
I can't smile, I don't see no more good in me now, if you don't
'Cause

Lately, I have tears cloudin' up my eyes
Comes out of nowhere, middle of a conversation
Waitin' for it and not a clear sky (clear sky)
I'm underwater

Whenever you're cold, I'm shiverin'
Whenever you're stoned, I'm hoverin' (yeah, yeah)
It's like whenever you're gone, I'm losin' it
Like baby, I'll go where you go
Whenever you fall, I'll fall behind
Whenever you're stuck, I see red lights
Whenever you're gone, I'm not alright (now that you're gone)
'Cause baby, I'll go where you go
Now baby, I'll go where you go

Now, baby, I'll go where you go
Now, baby, I'll go where you go
I'll go where you go
Now, baby, I'll go where you go
Now, baby, I'll go where you go
Now, baby, I'll go where you go
I'll go where you go
Now, baby, I'll go where you go (go)
Now, baby, I'll go where you go
Now, baby, I'll go where you go
