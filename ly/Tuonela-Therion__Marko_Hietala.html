		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathing the nightsky all alone
On through the darksome desert I roam
Last of the hidden steps of life –
Trembling I cross it – what will I find...?

As the lonely shades of you –
A descend so crystalline –
If I were a soul I'd speak your name and fly
Never have no spirits been
Flowing back to wonder fields
As the starlight and the dewdrops fade away, to be...

(Tuoni open up)
In the eye of wisdom
(Tuoni open up)
Under ground and sea –
(Tuoni open up)
Kingdom of forever!

(Tuoni opеn up)
Through the eye of wisdom
(Tuoni opеn up)
Tell me, will I see
(Tuoni open up)
Every souls endeavor?

Plains deserted – do I dream?
Woeful island, endless streams
Truth transcending into the flow
Turns to dust the waves I know

In the distance you behold
From the east, a gliding swan
On its face of blue the river veils the dawn
For the past within your chest
Will no more your heart caress
And encircled by the darkness you now touch the depths...

(Tuoni open up)
In the eye of wisdom
(Tuoni open up)
Under ground and sea –
(Tuoni open up)
Kingdom of forever!
Kingdom forever!

(Tuoni open up)
Through the eye of wisdom
(Tuoni open up)
Tell me, will I see
(Tuoni open up)
Every souls endeavor
Every souls endeavor?
