		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sans! Sans! Wake up! (What is it, dude?)
A human has fallen from the surface world
(Really? And you got a bone
To pick with him?) ugh! No time for puns
(Ah, c'mon, that was a real rib-tickler, ay)
Ugh! Enough! (Alright, here we go again)

Welcome to the underground how was the fall?
If you wanna look around give us a call
We don't see humans often
We're happy you just dropped in
I'll be so popular when I show all
The monsters what I just brought in

Hey! Papyrus, mind your manners
Can it, Sans, no time for banter
Excuse my brother, he's a bit eccentric
You're just lazy and apathetic!
Call me what you want, I got thick skin
Another bad joke and I'm finished with him!
We are monsters, the awfullest kind
To mess with us takes a lot of spine

We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
Humans betrayed us and left us burnin'
One day we'll make our way
Back to the surface
Through all your travels
Your sins will follow
Your consequences aren't easy to swallow
Who's the real monster, now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone

Really, Sans? What?
The last line of the chorus is a pun? Yup
You imbecile! That was very clever
Heh thanks, buddy

You're stuck in the underground
Thanks to the fall
Good luck ever getting out prepare to brawl
You could show mercy to us
Or turn all of us to dust
Is your heart full of evil or full of love?

I, the great Papyrus
Challenge you to try getting by us
Test the human with one of your puzzles
Brilliant, Sans
That will leave him befuddled!
I dare you to try a bite of spaghetti
Smells like the Creepypasta's ready
Stop it, Sans! I'm done with the jokin'!
Sounds like someone's funny bone's broken
(ha ha ha)

We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
I am the mastermind, he's my accomplice
You're only still alive because
I made a promise you'll lose your mind when
You wander for hours
You might even decide to
Start talkin' to flowers
Who's the real monster, now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone

Someday I'll join the Royal Guard
When I catch this child, can it be that hard?
Look, if I'm being honest
My brother ain't nothin' but harmless
I know you and all that you want
You'll get a lot more from Sans than a font
The deeper you go, the messier it gets
If I had it my way, you'd already be dead
Kidding, if you couldn't tell
I get so bored, I amuse myself
(ha ha ha ha ha)

Down here in the underground
You're all alone we wanted to tell you now
You're kinda boned
If you survive this prison
You will know nihilism
Don't mess around with monsters
They're scared of tiny children (Ha)

You've come far, but soon you'll stumble
When I stump you with some Junior Jumble
Not so sure you'll get him with that
Alas, I'll hit him with my Special Attack
Leave me alone!
You know I've got a knack for the trom-bone
One more pun, and I'll be done
But ain't two skulls better than one?

We can relate to your determination
Because we monsters have our motivations
You know your story's already been told
We can play again if you sell your soul
I've got my eye on you so you just watch it
I'll find any skeletons inside your closet
Who's the real monster now you should know
You've cut this story down to the bone
