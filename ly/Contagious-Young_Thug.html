		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I'd be showin' off, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I can never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

I told my lawyer, "Change the situation"
Told the judge that I was always fakin'
But I know what's in my heart and I feel it beggin'
Told then let go of my boys, that would be amazin'
Try to blink out every time, I'm hidden in different spaces
Bought that same LaFerrari, told 'em keep it basic
Pulled up on them same lil' boys, told 'em let's get to racing
She don't need to know what it is, I bought my mom the Wagon
Yeah, keep on dodgin' years, my young nigga waitin'
I done gave away my Porsche, I throw up
I don't pass the torch, I pour up
Syrup, when I'm forced, I ho her
Out and in and I wreck her core
I took my finger and I remade the sore

I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I'd be showin' off, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I can never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

They always told me I'll be goin' places
Now I'm just surrounded by these different faces
But all of this applause, yeah, it come with hatred
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

Yeah, uh
Yesterday my daughter told me
"Daddy, you the best," I told her
"I'm makin' it back tonight
Baby, pass me that vest"
I know I'm livin' the fast life
But I sign niggas and I sign checks
I put a quarter mil' on my fingers just like Lil Baby, and they all baguettes
Every week I made four thousand, servin' bags for my big homie
I know I wasn't doin' it forever but it had moved me up from blowin' it
Sometimes you gotta take baby steps
But now you grown and gotta want it
Everything you doin', wonder every ho you screwin'
I ball like Harden, Jordan
I tried to keep my mouth closed
But I told 'em all the stories
I had five bitches with me in there lit like Robert Horry
I told my bitch, "From every strugglin' day, we buyin' the store"

I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I'd be showin' off, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I can never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

They always told me I'll be goin' places
Now I'm just surrounded by these different faces
But all of this applause, yeah, it come with hatred
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
