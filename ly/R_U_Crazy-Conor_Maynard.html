		  No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again
Are you joking? Must be joking
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Yeah, ain't no need to cry no more
When you break my heart into twenty four
I'll pick up the pieces you left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

I ain't your mister, no
'Cause I'm breakin' up with ya
Shoulda hooked up with your sister
Go now, here's my middle finger

'Cause I'm hurting, baby, hurting, baby
Look what you did

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again
Are you joking? Must be joking
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Yeah, I'm with my boys, hit the town
Let's go see what kind of chick knocks me out
Now I know that she wants me back
Nothing sounds more better than "Hit the road, Jack" (Jack)

Don't call me mister,
Girl, I've broken up with ya
Love me now, my name is bigger
Girl, I'm giving you the finger

'Cause I'm hurting, baby, hurting, baby
Look what you did

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again (start again)
Are you joking? Must be joking
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again
Are you joking? Must be joking
I ain't smo-smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no (sing it with me now!)

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no (you must be crazy, yeah, yeah)
No no no no 

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no (oh, oh)

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no

You don't understand
There's no second chance for us, baby
It's not a game, so why are you tryin' to play me?
Now I gotta go, I'm not gonna stay and watch you cry

'Cause I'm hurting, baby, hurting, baby
Look what you did

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again (start again)
Are you joking? Must be joking
You ain't laughin', I ain't smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Are you crazy?
Must be stupid if you think that we can start again
Are you joking? Must be joking
I ain't smo-smokin'
Must be crazy if you think that we can start again

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no (hit the road, Jack)

No, no no no no
No no no no no no
No, no no no no
No no no no (hit the road, Jack, Jack)
