DC, Destiny Child (Slim Thugga)

You need to stop playing 'round with all them clowns and the wankstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangsta's
Go 'head girl, put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got it, flaunt it, boy, I know you want it
While I turn around, you watch me check up on it
Ooh, you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you watch me in amazement
You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I might let you have it
You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gon' make you chase it
You've got to be patient, I like my men patient
More patience, you take my, get you in more places
You can't be abrasive, has to know to pace it
If I let you get up on it, you gotta make a promise
That you gon' put it on me, like no one's put it on me
Don't bore me, just show me, all men talk, but don't please
I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you

Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight
Ooh, boy, you looking like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let 'em check up on it, watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

I'm checking on you boo, do what you do
And while dance I'ma glance at this beautiful view
I'm keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue 'em with glue
I'm in a trance all eyes on you and your crew
Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
It won't hurt if you gon' try one time
They all hot, but let me see this ones mine
It's slim thug and DC outta H town
