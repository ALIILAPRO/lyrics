		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, speak to me, but don't you say a word
Light a cigarette, I'll watch it as it burns
Remember telling me that you thought you were cursed
I'm in love with every song you've ever heard

If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood
If I could lose you, I would
We buried your bones in plywood

I said love is fast asleep
On a dirt road with your head on my shoulder

Strawberry wine, and all the time we used to have
Those things I miss, but know are never coming back
For you, darling, for you
No thing defines a man like love that makes him soft
And sentimental like a stranger in the park
For a few moments, I see you

If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway, and every time we run straight over it
If I was empty space and you were a formless shape, we'd fit
But love leaves little runway, and every time I run straight over it
