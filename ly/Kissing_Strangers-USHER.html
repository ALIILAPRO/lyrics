		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it messed up I hoped you would be here
Only so I could act like I don't care?
Been a blur for the last two months
Got a glass on my lips and a burn in my chest
Got some new fingertips on the back of my neck
Gotta try to pretend
Gotta try to forget somehow
But how, how?

How we go from strangers kissing to kissing strangers?
From not knowing your name to wishing I could erase it?
Tryna forget with somebody new
That I'm missing you
How we go from strangers kissing to kissing strangers?
From feeling every high there is to just feeling anxious?
Tryna forget in a crowded room
That I'm missing you

All of the nights we stayed up making plans
Now I stay up trying to understand (I understand)
Been a blur for the last three months
Got a glass on my lips and a burn in my chest
Got some new fingertips on the back of my neck
Gotta try to pretend
I would die to forget somehow
But how, how?

How we go from strangers kissing to kissing strangers?
From not knowing your name to wishing I could erase it?
Tryna forget with somebody new
That I'm missing you
How we go from strangers kissing to kissing strangers?
From feeling every high there is to just feeling anxious?
Tryna forget in a crowded room
That I'm missing you

Still see your face
In everybody, everybody
Can't feel the space
With anybody, anybody

How we go from strangers kissing to kissing strangers?
From not knowing your name to wishing I could erase it?
Tryna forget with somebody new
That I'm missing you
How we go from strangers kissing to kissing strangers?
From feeling every high there is to just feeling anxious?
Tryna forget in a crowded room
That I'm missing you

Still see your face
Can't feel the space
Tryna forget in a crowded room
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you
That I'm missing you
