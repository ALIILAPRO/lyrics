		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I'm here
And summer is gone I hear
So pray for me
As I now leave your town

When did I say this
I will never leave
I can't recall this
Moment in my life

You would never sleep at night
If you knew what I've been through
And this thought is all I have
To trust upon when light is gone

My problem was
That you kept me here too long
And today is when
We'll regret that I came by

When did I say this
I will never leave
I can't recall this
Moment in my life

Life is full of darkness
And murderers come my way
Someday you will join them
And I will let you in
