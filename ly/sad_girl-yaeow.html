		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a sad girl
But don't be sad girl
You deserve the world
You might not see it
But your scars are healing
The best it yet to come
Don't you know you're beautiful
And it's not your fault
You're feeling this way

God I wish you could see yourself
The way you talk and the way dance
I can tell, everybody wants to be your friend
You changed the way that I see myself
It's not that bad to be different
It's not fair, if only you could do that for yourself
But It's hurting me to know

You're a sad girl
But don't be sad girl
You deserve the world
You might not see it
But your scars are healing
The best it yet to come
Don't you know you're beautiful
And its not your fault
You're feeling this way

We were kids in a simple world
Worn out shoes and a dirty shirt
With no plans, maybe we should be more like that
Cause we got lost in a bitter dream
Tired of trying to be everything
But I got you, and I'm always gonna know that you got me
Still it's hurting me to know

You're a sad girl
But don't be sad girl
You deserve the world
You might not see it
But your scars are healing
The best it yet to come
Don't you know you're beautiful?
And its not your fault
You're feeling this way

Don't you know you're beautiful
And its not your fault
You're feeling this way
