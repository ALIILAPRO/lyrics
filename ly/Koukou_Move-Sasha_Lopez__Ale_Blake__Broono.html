		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What?! Koukou move!
Start a party, we need to start a party
Start a party, we need to start a party
Now let me see that koukou move!

So tonight
We can dance together
In the light
Don't deny
Yeah, it can last forever
If you'd like

La boca linda
La boca linda
You're my drug
So give me more
Say oh oh oh
La boca linda
La boca linda
Come to me and lose control
Let's go oh oh oh

Start a party, we need to start a party
Start a party, we need to start a party
Now let me see that koukou move!

Now tonight
We can dance together
In the light
Don't deny
Yeah, it can last forever
If you'd like

La boca linda
La boca linda
You're my drug
So give me more
Say oh oh oh
La boca linda
La boca linda
Come to me and lose control
Let's go oh oh oh

Start a party, we need to start a party
Start a party, we need to start a party
Now let me see that koukou move!

I need your loving today
Can't let it fade away
Oh oh oh oh oh
You make me feel divine
I want you to be mine
Oh oh oh oh oh

Start a party, we need to start a party
Start a party, we need to start a party

Now let me see that koukou move!
