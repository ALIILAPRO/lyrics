		  Tried to save myself
But myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself
But myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself
But myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself
But myself keeps slipping away

Talking to myself all the way to the station
Pictures in my head of the final destination all lined up
All lined up, all the one's that aren't allowed to stay
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

Tried to save a place from the cuts and the scratches
Tried to overcome the complications and the catches
Nothing ever grows and the sun doesn't shine all day
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)
(Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away)

Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away
Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping away

Tried to save myself but myself keeps slipping
