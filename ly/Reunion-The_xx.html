		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We visit a life we both left behind
Ignore the heart
Move to the ever-moving
Or, blazin', we go over
And over and over and over again

If I wait too long
I'll lose you from my sight
Maybe tonight
I could stop dreaming
And start believing in forever
And ever and ever and ever again

Reunion, reunion
Reunion, reunion
Never not ever, never not ever again

And it's burning inside 'til you give it up
How long should I wait?
There's no need to hide, from this
Only you in here

There's an end to us with someone else inside
You shine your light
There goes that feeling, won't let me see them
Never not ever, never not ever again

Did I see you, see me, in a new light?
Did I see you, see me, in a new light?
Did I see you, see me, in a new light? (Never not ever again)
Did I (Never not ever) see you (Ever again)
See me (Never not ever) in a new light? (Never not ever again)
Did I see you, see me?
Never not ever, never not ever again
