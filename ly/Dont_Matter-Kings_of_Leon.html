		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Such a swine, lips like wine but it don't matter to me
Take a turn before I burn and it don't matter to me
Like a snake awake and vague, it don't matter to me
I can fuck or I can fight, it don't matter to me

'Cause it's always the same
And I'm always the same, whoa

Uncle Sam, he looks ?, but it don't matter to me
I don't know where I'm gonna go, it don't matter to me
You could be ? my seed but it don't matter to me

'Cause it's always the same
And I'm always the same, whoa

I'm not a man everybody said but it don't matter to me
I get her feet on my seat butï»¿ it don't matter to me
Break my heart tear me apart, it don't matter to me, no no
I put a shine in your eye it don't matter to me

'Cause it's always the same
And I'm always the same, whoa
