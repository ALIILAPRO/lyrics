		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once you told me
Look for the north star, then you'll see
Heavenly, I hear
Found my way to the beach
And there were waves over me
I was lost at sea
'Til you found me, 'til you found me
Ha-ha-ha-ha, happily
Happily, happily
I was found lost at sea
Ah, ah
Mm, oh
Lost at sea

Happily, happily
I was found lost at sea
