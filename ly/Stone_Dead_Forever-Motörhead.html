		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And didn't you see me in the glass
And didn't you hear me you never listen past
And didn't I see you gone to seed
And the only reason is that you're too young greed

You're out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever

You're in perhaps you'll listen a judge like you
In your sweet life innocence that's nobody's fault
You've never had it quite so good
Because you didn't know that you even could

At times it's been too old
Your judge turned to gold
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever

And it's been a long, long time been a long, long wait
And then you thought you'd beat us at the pearly gates
You better leave your number, oh and we'll call you
You must admit your problem and it's heckling you

The time has come to pay
Turns out you've been the prey
Whatever happened to your life
Stone dead forever
