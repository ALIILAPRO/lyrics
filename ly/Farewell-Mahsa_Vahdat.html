		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a mountain behind the mountain  
But the sky is one
There are stars with gentile light
 and each star directs  to a different sea 
There is  dense silence 
and there is another silence cold and hard
And between those two a rose was picked 
Each rose will die in its homeland
will  give life to another rose

The same 
The same Darkness shelters the lovers and the broken ones
The same Whiteness unites the shrouds and the newborns ones
The same heart beats walking down an aisle and  when one is walking away 
And  the  silence is the same when it is created in monotony
And in the seconds before the scream of pain.

There is a desert  that starts with the night
 and ends with whispered secrets
secrets carried by galloping horses
secrets consumed by the fire
even if the whispering  coals extinguish in me 
or if I will be flooded by loneliness
there is a voice that never dies and if it dies 
A rose will grow
