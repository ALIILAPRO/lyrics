		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was nine, I fell in love
This peace corps guy
I waited hours
Inside his tent with flowers
Which made him laugh
Which made me cry

By thirteen I gave up trying
I decided I would be a mathematician
'Cause math is real
I memorized a lot of pi
Because addition and subtractions and division
Would never make me feel
So stupid with love

I didn't get it
I didn't get it, somehow
Smart with math but stupid with love
I didn't get it
I didn't get it
'Til now

Mm
So thank you, math, for being there
To bring me joy
And thank you, math
'Cause now you've brought me this cute boy

He's like someone from TV
He's like that guy who gives out roses to those women
His clothes, his grooming
And he's foot away from me
With swoopy hair and shiny eyes that I could swim in
He is live and in the room!

And I'm stupid with love
I wanna get it
I wanna get it, but how?
Smart with math, but stupid with love
I wanna get it
I didn't get it 'til now

Mm-hmm

I'm astounded and non-plussed
I am filled with calculust
Does this guy work out? He must
All sweaty at the gym
Could that image be more hot?
Let me just enjoy that thought
School was rough but now it's not
'Cause now there's him

Stupid with love
I didn't get it
I didn't get it, somehow
Smart with math but stupid with love
I didn't get it
I didn't get it 'til now
