		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, no, no, no
No, no, no
Oh, ba, ba, ba, da, da
I hope you're gonna
Ooh, oh, no, no, no
My love, you're gonna make it all
I just wanna tell ya how I feel, woo!

If my body was a boat, could you steer that, sailor? (Mmm)
Make it feel like it's a 1960s Hollywood trailer (old-school, I like)
Classic like cars, classic like Elizabeth Taylor (Taylor, Taylor)
Uh, need you to romance me, yeah, I need a giver, not a taker
Ooh, it's what I need

Yes, 'cause I could love you if I really wanted to
You could be, be my glass of wine
When the sun sets, help me exhale
All the excess

Baby, bae, b-b-bae, b-b-baby, would you
Would you make it alright?
Or maybe that much better?
If you wanted you could make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it
Ooh, when I see the sun rising
You make it that much better
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it

Ooh, worth all of the time I'm 'bout to give you, baby
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it
Ooh, give all of the time I should be be working on me
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it

Mmm, this is the night (something 'bout it's making me cry)
My soul, it did decide (feel my body shiver in your moonlight)
And I need you to (let me have the time of my life)
Checked your credentials
South residentials
Ooh, baby boy, you got so much potential

I could love you if I really wanted to
You could be, be my glass of wine
When the sun sets, help me exhale
All the excess

Baby, bae, b-b-bae, b-b-baby, would you (baby, would you)
Would you make it alright? (Would you make it alright?)
Or maybe that much better? (Or maybe that much better)
If you wanted you could make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it (if you wanted to)
Ooh, when I see the sun rising
You make it that much better
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it

Ooh, worth all of the time I'm 'bout to give you, baby
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it
Ooh, give all of the time I should be be working on me
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it

Drip me out in six-carat Cartier rings, baby
(Babe) top floor in the penthouse, sipping on Chardonnay 2016, baby
(On the top floor) something like a dream, babe
Somehow I'm so captured by you
I'm rearranging all of my plans
And I'm holding my breath
As I hope you make it worth it

Would you make it alright
Or maybe that much better?
If you wanted you could make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it
Ooh, when I see the sun rising
You make it that much better
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it

Ooh, worth all the time I'm 'bout to give you, baby
So I hope you're gonna make it all
Worth it, worth it, worth it, worth it
Ooh, give all of the time I should be be working on me
So I hope you're gonna make it all
(Worth it, worth it, worth it)

This is the night (this is the night)
My soul, it did decide
And I need you to (I need you to)
I'm all in, I can't reverse it
So I hope and pray you make it
(All worth it) ah, ah, ooh, yeah
