		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish you hadn't, had to show me the end
Was nearer than old age and a bed
What beauty there was in a pose so still
Oh it haunts my dreams and I dream it still
I could never seem to shed a tear
Cold as ice for half a year
And then one day your face appeared
Oh I hadn't wept such weight in years
Oh he's not for you
Oh he's pulling through
Oh what did he do
Oh he's not for you
We said goodbye, and we made you clean
We purged with fire and we set to sea
We let you go, and you took the breeze
All in all, it was meant to be
I couldn't tell you why, it makes no sense to me
