		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Joey will come, to see your flowers
Joey will come, to while away your hours
She will tell you you're not so good for her
She wouldn't be there if it could be that you were

Joey has loved, never shown her tears
So she may laugh in the autumn of your years
When you're with her you'll wonder if it's true
All that they said of a world without you

Where she may come from, where she may go
Who she may run from, no one will know
Why she was late may trouble you some
Still you wait for Joey to come

Joey will come when once more it looks like snow
Joey will come when it's really time to go
And you may smile when you find that you've been wrong
You thought you found her but she knew you all along
But Joey will come to say hello, Joey
