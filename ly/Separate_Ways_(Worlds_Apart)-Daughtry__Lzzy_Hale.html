		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we stand
Worlds apart, hearts broken in two, two, two
Sleepless nights
Losing ground, I'm reaching for you, you, you

Feeling that it's gone
Can't change your mind
If we can't go on to survive the tide
Love divides

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Troubled times
Caught between confusion and pain, pain, pain
Distant eyes
Promises we made were in vain, in vain, in vain

If you must go
I wish you luck
You'll never walk alone
Take care, my love
Miss you, love

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Oh
I still love you, babe
I still love you, girl
I will love you, babe
I will love you, girl
Oh

Someday love will find you
Break those chains that bind you
One night will remind you
How we touched and went our separate ways
If he ever hurts you
True love won't desert you
You know I still love you
Though we touched and went our separate ways

Though we went our separate ways
Though we went our separate ways
Though we went our separate ways
Though we went our separate ways
Though we went our separate ways
Though we went our separate ways
