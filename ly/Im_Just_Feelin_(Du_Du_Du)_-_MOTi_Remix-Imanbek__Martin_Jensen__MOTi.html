		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't wait to get off my shift
To treat myself with that gift
My body says, "I don't need it"
But fuck it, just wanna feel it
I wanna re-live the dream
Where everyone knows 'bout me
Treat me like I'm the baddest of them all

It's you (oh yeah, yeah)
Like my world recovers
We don't need no others
'Cause with you
All I see is roses
Wavin' in slow motion

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du
I'm just, I'm just

I wish that there was no end
For the show with my head
High up, up on the ceiling
Is where I found my heart beatin'
Trip along for our fun (fun)
People are passing by
No one can kill my vibe when I'm with you (no)

It's you
Like my world recovers
We don't need no others
'Cause with you
All I see is roses
Wavin' in slow motion

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du (oh, yeah)
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du (oh, yeah)
Du-du, du-du

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du (I'm feelin' you)
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm feelin')
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm 'feelin' you)
Du-du, du-du

I'm just feelin' du-du, du-du-du (I'm feelin' you)
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm feelin')
Du-du-du, du-du-du (I'm 'feelin' you)
Du-du, du-du, I'm just feelin'

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why
But I just feel it when I feel it
Every night, every night, every night
Every night, every night, every night
I lose my mind to feel this rhythm

Du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du-du, du-du-du
Du-du, du-du
I'm just feelin' du-du-du-du-du
