		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, ooh

Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Rhythm 
You can feel it 
People feel it
Rhythm 
Rhythm is a dancer
Rhythm 
You can feel it 
People feel it
Rhythm 
Rhythm is a dancer

Let the rhythm ride you, guide you
Sneak inside you, set your mind to
Move to its pulsation
Bass vibration, synth sensation
Pause, it's not in place, see
Mind and body must be free to
Please, take it all in
Nothing to lose, everything to win
But it controls you, holds you, molds you
Back to old or new
Touch it, taste it
Free your soul and let it face you
Got to be what you wanna
If the groove don't get ya
The rifle's gonna
I'm serious as cancer
When I say, "Rhythm is a dancer"

Rhythm is a dancer 
It's a soul's companion
People feel it everywhere
Lift your hands and voices 
Free your mind and join us
You can feel it in the air

Oh, it's a passion
Oh, you can feel it in the air
Oh, it's a passion
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Rhythm 
You can feel it 
People feel it
Rhythm 
Rhythm is a dancer
Rhythm 
You can feel it 
People feel it
Rhythm 
Rhythm is a dancer
