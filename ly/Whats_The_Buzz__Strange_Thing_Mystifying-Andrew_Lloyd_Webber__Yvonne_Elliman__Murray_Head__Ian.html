		  What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening

Why should you want to know?
Don't you mind about the future
Don't you try to think ahead
Save tomorrow for tomorrow
Think about today instead

What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening 
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening (I could give you facts and figures)
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening (When do we ride into Jerusalem?)
When do we ride into Jerusalem?
Even tell you where I'm going (When do we ride into Jerusalem?)

When do we ride into Jerusalem?
When do we ride into Jerusalem?
When do we ride into Jerusalem?
When do we ride into Jerusalem?

Why should you want to know?
Why are you obsessed with fighting
Times and fates you can't defy?
If you knew the path we're riding
You'd understand it less then I

What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
Let me try to cool down your face a bit
Let me try to cool down your face a bit
Let me try to cool down your face a bit
Let me try to cool down your face a bit
Let me try to cool down your face 
Let me try to cool down your face 
Let me try to cool down your face 
Let me try to cool down your face 

Mary uh that is good
While you prattled through your supper
Where and when and who and how
She alone has tried to give me
What I need right here and now

What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz? Tell me what's happening

It seems to me a strange thing, mystifying
That a man like you can waste his time
On women of her kind
Yes, I can understand that she amuses
But to let her stroke you, kiss your hair
Is hardly in your line
It's not that I object to her profession
But she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
They only need a small excuse to put us all away

Who are you to criticize her?
Who are you to despise her?
Leave her, leave her, let her be now
Leave her, leave her, she's with me now
If your slate is clean, then you can throw stones
If your slate is not, then leave her alone
I'm amazed that a man like you
Can be so shallow, thick and slow
There is not a man among you
Who knows or cares if I come or go

No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong
No you're wrong! You're very wrong
How can you say that, how can you say that, how can you say that, how can you say that
Not one, not one of you!
