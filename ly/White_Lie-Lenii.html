		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

Maybe it's pretentious
Convoluted but the truth is
I've been thinking
It seems the Devil's always winning
From the beginning had me on a string
Wrapped around your finger
On the trigger
Shoot me down 'cause you know you can hold me
Now you stand on a ground most holy
Maybe it's pretentious
Convoluted but the truth is
I've been thinking
It seems the Devil's always winning

I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

It's a little bigger than a white lie (Yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy (Yeah)
It's a little bigger than a white lie (Yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy
Good guy yeah

Just because the lie's white
Doesn't sit right
Doesn't make it honest cause the tone's light
As I see it, here's the situation
Everyone's polite until their pushed to being brazen
Don't pretend that you're higher than Pius
In the end we all fight to be highest
Tryna stand out my own light
But keep hearing
you sound a bit like Tones And I

I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

It's a little bigger than a white lie (Yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy (Yeah)
It's a little bigger than a white lie (Yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy
Good guy yeah

I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

It's a little bigger than a white lie (Yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy (Yeah)
It's a little bigger than a white lie (Yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy
Good guy yeah
