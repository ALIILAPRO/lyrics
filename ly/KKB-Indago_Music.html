		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you know this pussy
Is what you like
And you know this pussy
Will fuck ya life
And you know this pussy
Is what you like
And you know this pussy
Will fuck ya life
Say he like the pretty kitty
Tight, ripe, love me long time
He love to give me head
Like it’s always on his mind
Sweet caramel
With the lust in his eyes
Yea, he gotta be hung
If he’s my kinda guy
Said he’d like to take a trip
And dip in
Lips so soft yea
You have to lick ‘em
Cream so tight
Can’t wait to stick ‘em
Clit so wet
Watch out you’ll slip in
This ain’t your average (Uh uh)
This is for savages
You’ll get your ass handed
If you can’t handle it(You can’t handle it)
This ain’t your average
This is for savages (Uh huh)
You’ll get your ass handed
If you can’t handle it
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom (Kitty kat, kitty kat, kitty kat, boom bitch)
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
This is pussy not riddles
Why you looking so puzzled?
Wrap my legs round neck
Strap me on like a muzzle
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
Put the pussy in his face
Now he wanna take me home
Wanna take me home
Now he wanna take me home
Wanna take me home
Now he wanna take me home
Wanna take me home
Now he wanna take me home
Wanna take me home
Now he wanna take me home
Wanna take, wanna take
Wanna take, wanna take
Wanna take, wanna take
Wanna take, wanna take
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna
Wanna, wanna, wanna
And you know this pussy
Is what you like
And you know this pussy
Will fuck ya life
And you know this pussy
Is what you like
And you know this pussy
Will fuck ya life
And you know this pussy
Is what you like
And you know this pussy
Will fuck ya life, fuck ya life
Fuck, fuck ya life
And you know this pussy
Is what you like
This ain’t your average (Uh uh)
This is for savages
You’ll get your ass handed
If you can’t handle it(You can’t handle it)
This ain’t your average
This is for savages (Uh huh)
You’ll get your ass handed
If you can’t handle it
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom (Kitty kat, kitty kat, kitty kat, boom bitch)
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
This is pussy not riddles
Why you looking so puzzled?
Wrap my legs round neck
Strap me on like a muzzle
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat, Kitty Kat boom
Put the pussy in his face
Now he wanna take me home
