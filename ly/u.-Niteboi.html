		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You love me and I love you
Your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I say, "Fuck you, I hate you"
I move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me 
And you tell me that you sorry

You love me and I love you
Your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I say, "Fuck you, I hate you"
I move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me 
And you tell me that you sorry (sorry, sorry, sorry)

Love me and I love you
Your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep
But it's our world, it's just us two
I say, "Fuck you, I hate you"
I move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me 
And you tell me that you sorry (sorry, sorry, sorry)
