		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not the guy who cared about love
And I'm not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
I never cared much
Oh, look at you now

I never knew the technique of kissing
I never knew the thrill I could get from your touch
I never knew much
Oh, look at you now

You're a new man better than Casanova at his best
With a new heart and a brand new start
I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest

So you the guy who turned out a lover
Yes I'm the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
Oh, look at you now

He's not the guy who cared about love
And he's not the guy who cared about fortunes and such
Cared about much
But, look at him now

(I'm a lover) He never knew the technique of kissing
He never knew the thrill he could get form her touch
Never knew much
But, look at him now

Man I really come on
He's a new man better than (Casanova at his best, right up)
With a new start, a brand new heart
He's so proud he's bustin' his vest

So he's the guy who turned out a lover
So he's the guy who laughed at those blue diamond rings
One of those things
But, look at me now

He's a new man better than Casanova at his best
He's got some new (?)
Well, I'm so proud I'm bustin' my vest
He's a lover, yes, we know he's a lover
Yes
I laughed at those blue diamond rings
Just one of those things
But, look at him now
Jack I'm ready
Look at him now
