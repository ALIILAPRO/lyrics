		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleeping is giving in
No matter what the time is
Sleeping is giving in
So lift those heavy eyelids
People say that you'll die faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son, scare your daughter

People say that your dreams are the only things that save ya
Come on, baby, in our dreams
We can live our misbehavior

Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes
Every time you close your eyes

People try and hide the night underneath the covers
People try and hide the light underneath the covers

Come on hide your lovers
Underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers
Underneath the covers
Hidin' from your brothers underneath the covers
Come on hide your lovers underneath the covers

People say that you'll die faster than without water
But we know it's just a lie
Scare your son, scare your daughter
Scare your son, scare your daughter
Scare your son, scare your daughter

Now here's the sun, it's alright (lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright (lies, lies)
Now here's the sun, it's alright (lies, lies)
Now here's the moon, it's alright (lies, lies)

But every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)
Every time you close your eyes (lies, lies)

Every time you close your eyes
(Lies, lies)
