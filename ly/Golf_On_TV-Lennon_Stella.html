		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up to the bed made
And you're downstairs
Doing the dishes
And my mom's there
She's kind of obsessed with you
I think that I might be too
She thinks that you're good for me
That's not something I'm used to

I keep getting overwhelmed
When I talk about us out loud
'Cause I want you
And only you
It's simple as
You want me too

Some people wanna switch it up
Like just one love
Could never be enough
Some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

Some people think it's supposed to hurt
Like it couldn't be real
If it's putting you first
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

You just been so consistent
That stability
It's so healthy
It's confusing me
I'm done with romanticizing
Dysfunction and compromising
You treat me so well
It's weird
But I love how much I like it

Some people wanna switch it up
Like just one love
Could never be enough
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

Some people think it's supposed to hurt
Like it couldn't be real
If it's putting you first
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

If the old me
Met the new me
She'd probably
Try to stop me
But I want you
And only you
It's as simple as
You want me too

Some people wanna switch it up
Like just one love
Could never be enough
But some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me

Some people think it's supposed to hurt
Like it couldn't be real
If it's putting you first
Some people watch golf on TV
And neither of those things make sense to me
