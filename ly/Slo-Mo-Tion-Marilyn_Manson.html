		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’ve got your
Hell’s teeth
Smiling at you
It keeps your brain safe
As it all eats at your face
And don’t worry
We’ll blur it out
And no one
Ever will know

Oh
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slow motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slow motion

Pump in the laughter
Of dead audience applause
And teenage rape candidates
I think we got ourselves
A real hit
Don’t we wish
That we could feel something
More than
Hate and morbid panic
Morbid panic
Hate and morbid panic

This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slow motion
This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slow motion

And I’m the host with Vaseline
I hide behind bulletproof glass
And I can feel your tits
With my brand new camera
Equipped with a flash
Fast-food-nude
I hate you all
But somehow
You find me
Incredibly charming

Slow motion
Slow motion

This is my beautiful show
And everything is shot
In slow motion
