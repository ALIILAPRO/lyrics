		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got scars and I do too
Never thought I'd be one for you
Baby it's nothing new
I just wanna learn to love you

Put up these walls
Try to cover my past
Eventually it all circles back
I used to have faith until I relapsed
I wish that I could face the facts

I got scars and you do too
Never thought you'd be one for me
Lately I feel like I was born to lose
But when I'm with you I don't feel lonely

No I don't feel lonely no
(No I don't feel, don't feel)
No I don't feel lonely no

Hard when we both know
It's time to let go
God I pray that we never do
Memories all go back to you
Time and space won't make a difference
I only write this in hopes you're somewhere listening

Put up these walls
Try to cover my past
Eventually it all circles back
I used to have faith until I relapsed
I wish that I could face the facts

I got scars and you do too
Never thought you'd be one for me
Lately I feel like I was born to lose
But when I'm with you I don't feel lonely

No I don't feel lonely no
(No I don't feel, don't feel)
No I don't feel lonely no
No, No, Nah
No I don't feel lonely no
(No I don't feel, don't feel)
No I don't feel lonely no
