		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been on the rocks for awhile now
Cause no one shot me straight
I didn't know how to settle down
And I didn't want to change

Till I took a look in that dive bar mirror
And all I saw were the tired eyes of a stranger

And this will be the last time
I sit here on this stool
For the first time I can see
All of the proof
I became everything that I hate just to numb the pain
Drowning in this bottle this will be the last time I quit
So I'm gonna drink it down till the last sip.

I've done a lot of sinnin'
That I don't remember
The scars on my knuckles serve as
A constant reminder
That whiskey can wipe my memory clean
And it brings out, the animal in me

And this will be the last time
I sit here on this stool
For the first time I can see
All of the proof
I became everything that I hate just to numb the pain
Drowning in this bottle this will be the last time I quit
So I'm gonna drink it down till the last sip.

I'm gonna say goodbye
To the side
Of me I never wanna see again

And this will be the last time
This has to be the last time

And this will be the last time
I sit here on this stool
For the first time I can see
All of the proof
I became everything that I hate just to numb the pain
Drowning in this bottle this will be the last time I quit
So I'm gonna drink it down till the last sip.
