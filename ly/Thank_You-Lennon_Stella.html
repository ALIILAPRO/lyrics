		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My tea's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
And oh-ooh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life, mmm-mmm

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
And oh-ooh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life, mmm-mmm
