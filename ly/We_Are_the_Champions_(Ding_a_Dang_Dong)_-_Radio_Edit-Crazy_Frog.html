		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ding a dang dong we're the champions

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions of the world

Ding a dang dong we're the champions

Ding a dang dong let's rock that sound (ding, ding)
Everybody hear what's going down (pum, pum)
Ding a dang dong we've reached the top (ding, ding)
Time and again from the penalty spot (pum, pum, pum)

Ding a dang dong in the stadium
(Ding a dang dong, ding a dang dong)
'Cause it's a goal, we have won
(Ding a dang dong for the champions)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions, we are the champions
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions of the world

Ding a dang dong we're the champions

Ding a dang dong we're the champions of the world
